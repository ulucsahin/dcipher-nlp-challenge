Despite its importance, the widespread use of thermoelectric devices is constrained because of the low efficiency of thermoelectric bulk alloys. However, boundary engineering has been demonstrated as one of the most effective ways to enhance the thermoelectric performance of conventional thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3, PbTe, and SiGe alloys because their thermal and electronic transport properties can be manipulated separately by this approach. We review our recent progress on the enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit through boundary engineering together with the processing technologies for boundary engineering developed most recently using Bi2Te3-based bulk alloys. A brief discussion of the principles and current status of boundary-engineered bulk alloys for the enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit is presented. We focus mainly on (1)the reduction of the thermal conductivity by grain boundary engineering and (2)the reduction of thermal conductivity without deterioration of the electrical conductivity by phase boundary engineering. We also discuss the next potential approach using two boundary engineering strategies for a breakthrough in the area of bulk thermoelectric alloys.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Recent Progress on Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators for SelfPowered Electronics", "Abstract": "Recently, smart systems have met with large success. At the origin of the internet of things, they are a key driving force for the development of wireless, sustainable, and independent autonomous smart systems. In this context, autonomy is critical, and despite all the progress that has been made in low-power electronics and batteries, energy harvesters are becoming increasingly important. Thus, harvesting mechanical energy is essential, as it is widespread and abundant in our daily life environment. Among harvesters, flexible triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) exhibit good performance, and they are easy to integrate, which makes them perfect candidates for many applications and, therefore, crucial to develop. In this review paper, we first introduce the fundamentals of TENGs, including their four basic operation modes. Then, we discuss the different improvement parameters. We review some progress made in terms of performance and integration that have been possible through the understanding of each operation mode and the development of innovative structures.

This film can simultaneously harness the chemical potential of light and aerial humidity gradients to convert them into mechanical work. The strong reversible hygroscopicity of the agarose matrix induces swift locomotion by mechanical deformation owing to exchange of water with the surroundings. Driven by humidity, a 20mg composite film coupled to a piezoelectric bending transducer sensor generates a peak output of approximately 80mV, which corresponds to a power density of 25Wkg(-1). Excitation with UV light triggers isomerization of the chromophore, which appears as reshaping by spiraling, bending, or twisting of the film. The material also responds to changes in the pHvalue by reversible protonation of the fluorophore with rapid changes in color and fluorescence. The threefold sensing capability of this smart material could be utilized for the fabrication of multiresponsive actuating dynamic elements in biomedicine and soft robotics.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "UV-Induced Tetrazole-Thiol Reaction for Polymer Conjugation and Surface Functionalization", "Abstract": "A UV-induced 1,3-dipolar nucleophilic addition of tetrazoles to thiols is described.

This 146-residue protein has a nine-stranded -sandwich fold, in which 35% of the residues are in the -sheet and the remainder are composed of loops and turns. Dynamically averaged H-1-C-13 dipolar coupling order parameters were extracted in a site-specific manner by using a pseudo-three-dimensional constant-time recoupled separated-local-field experiment (dipolar-chemical shift correlation experiment; DIPSHIFT). The backbone-C and C order parameters indicate that the majority of the protein, including turns, is rigid despite having a high content of loops; this suggests that restricted motions of the turns stabilize the loops and create a rigid structure. Water molecules, located in the crystalline interface between protein units, induce an increased dynamics of the interface residues thereby lubricating crystal water-mediated contacts, whereas other crystal contacts remain rigid.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Iron associated with exopolymeric substances is highly bioavailable to oceanic phytoplankton", "Abstract": "Growth limitation of marine algae due to lack of iron occurs in up to 40% of the global ocean. Despite important advances on the impact of organic compounds on iron biogeochemistry, their roles in controlling iron availability to prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton remain unclear. Whether algal and bacterial exopolymeric substances (EPS) include organic ligands which may help iron-limited phytoplankton growth remains an unknown. If so, then EPS could relieve phytoplankton iron limitation with implications for the biological carbon pump and hence the regulation of atmospheric CO2. Here we compared the biological impact of algal, bacterial and in situ EPS with model compounds, a siderophore and two saccharides on biological parameters including, iron bioavailability, phytoplankton growth, photo-physiology and community structure. Laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that EPS produced by marine microorganisms are efficient in sustaining biological iron uptake as well as algal growth, and can affect natural phytoplankton community structure. Our data suggest that natural phytoplankton growth enhancement in the presence of EPS was not solely due to highly bioavailable iron forms, but also because EPS contains other micronutrients. Stronger ligands were detected following iron-siderophore enrichments (log K-Fe'L = 12.0) and weaker ligands were measured in the presence of EPS (log K-Fe'L = 10.4-11.0). The trend of the conditional stability constants of organic ligands did not seem to be affected as a result of biological activity and photo-chemistry during our four day incubations. The shift in the phytoplankton community observed during our field experiments was not uniformly observed between different sites rendering it difficult to extrapolate which functional group(s) would benefit the most from iron bound to EPS.

Across five diverse river/estuary systems we find evidence of terrestrially derived ligands with binding constants (log K-Fe(II)L) mainly in the range 6-8. These Fe(II) ligands were stable over short time periods (1-2 days), generally equivalent to, or in excess of, ambient freshwater Fe(II) concentrations (which ranged from 12 to 3600 nM) and had similar binding constants to ligands that were leached by water from vegetation and detritus (log K-Fe(II)L 7-8). A class of terrestrially derived ligands may therefore be important in stabilising Fe(II) concentrations in freshwater systems. However, in coastal seawater the impact of these ligands upon Fe(II) speciation is likely to be diminished due to a combination of dilution, loss of humic material during flocculation and increased ionic strength. The temperate and sub-tropical river systems studied included the Beaulieu (England), Itchen (England), Cape Fear (North Carolina, USA), Winyah Bay (South Carolina, USA) and Loch Etive (Scotland). Freshwaters in each system possessed a broad range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 200-1300 mu M), labile dissolved Fe (LDFe, Fe < 0.2 mu m available to ferrozine after reduction with ascorbic acid, 100 nM-20 mu M) and pH (5.5-8.5). In the Itchen estuary, where anthropogenic discharge constitutes >10% of freshwater input, ligand binding constants were elevated (up to log K-Fe(II)L 11) and the expected decrease in LDFe with increasing salinity along the estuary was not observed (LDFe and DOC both peaked at a salinity of 7) due to effluent inputs.

Cu-HS adsorb on the mercury (Hg) surface and are quantified on the basis of the reduction current for complexed Cu. Humic acid reference material (Suwannee River humic acid, HA) was used to calibrate the voltammetric response for the HS. The method was used to determine the concentration of Cu-HS in estuarine and coastal seawater, giving very good agreement with HS determined by UV spectrophotometry. Optimised conditions include a Cu concentration of 20-50 nM, a deposition potential of 0.05 V, differential pulse mode and pH(NBs) 8.2. The presence of Cu-HS indicates that this may be an important species of Cu in estuarine waters. The complex stability of Cu-HA was determined by two methods giving a value of 12.08 for log KCu-HA' and a binding capacity of 18 nmol Cu for 1 mg of the HA. This complex stability is less than that (log K-CuL' = 14) of the strongest Cu complexes thought to occur in ocean waters suggesting that the Cu-HS could represent the weaker class of Cu-binding ligands. Iron was found to compete with copper for complexation with the HA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For the same purpose, exopolymeric substances (EPS) produced by laboratorycultured diatoms were collected as well. In our study areas, colloidal organic carbon (COC) concentrations ranged from 6.5 to 202 mu g-C/L in the Pacific Ocean, and were 808 mu g-C/L in the Gulf of Mexico. The COM compositions (organic carbon, organic nitrogen, proteins, total hydrolysable amino adds, total polysaccharides, uronic acids, hydroxamate siderophores, hydroquinone) were quantified to examine the relationships between partition coefficients (K-c) of five different radionuclides, Th-234, Pa-233, Ph-210, Po-210 and Be-7, and concentration ratios to COC of individual chelating biomolecules that could potentially act as a chelating moiety. The range of partition coefficients (K-c, reported as logK(c)) of radionuclides between water and the different colloidal materials was 5.12 to 5.85 for Th-234, 5.19 to 6.01 for Pa-233, 4.21 to 4.85 for Pb-210, 4.87 to 5.68 for Po-210, and 4.49 to 4.92 for Be-7, similar to values previously reported for lab and field determinations under different particle concentrations. While any relationship obtained between Kc and abundance of specific moieties could not be taken as proving the existence of colloidal organic binding ligands for the different radionuclides, it could suggest possible organic moieties involved in the scavenging of these natural radionuclides. Together with results from isoelectric focusing of radiolabeled COM, we conclude that binding to different biomolecules is nuclide-specific, with colloidal hydroxamate siderophoric moieties being important for the binding of Th and Pa radionuclides. Hydroquinones/quinone (HQ/Q.) facilitated redox and chelation reactions seem to be involved in the binding of Pa and Be. However, the actual mechanisms are not clear. Individual amino acids, proteins, total polysaccharides and uronic acids did not yield significant relationships with logK(c) values of the different radionuclides. Nonetheless, our results provide new insights into the relative importance of different potential ligand moieties in COM in the binding and possible scavenging of specific radionuclides in the ocean.

The etalon possesses one single interference peak in the visible region, and the interference peak changes sensitively against the concentration of the external stimulant (water vapor) or the temperature of the system, owing to the responsiveness of the PNIPAM brush. Importantly, the as-prepared etalon shows a rapid response rate and excellent the responsive etalon based on a conventional micro-fabrication method.

These heterostructures are prepared by seed-mediated routes, where the structure, composition, and morphology of the CdSe nanocrystals used as a seed play key roles in directing the growth of the second semiconducting domain. The local structural environment of all the elements in the CdSe@CdS heterostructures was investigated at the Cd, S, and Se K-edges by taking advantage of the selectivity of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and was compared to pure reference compounds. We found that the structural features of dot@rods are independent of the size of the rods. These structures can be described as made of a CdSe dot and a CdS rod, both in the wurtzite phase with a high crystallinity of both the core and the rod. This result supports the effectiveness of high temperature colloidal synthesis in promoting the formation of core@shell nanocrystals with very low defectivity. On the other hand, data on the CdSe@CdS with octapod morphology suggest the occurrence of a core composed of a CdSe cubic sphalerite phase with eight pods made of CdS wurtzite phase.

One-dimensional nanorods were constructed by the self-aggregation of 4-(phenyl-azo)benzoic acid (PBA) molecules in aqueous solution at pH 3.2. As the pH of the solution was increased to 6.5, these nanorods transformed into two-dimensional polygons. Upon UV irradiation, the as-prepared nanorods disappeared completely, and nanospheres were subsequently obtained. On the basis of the weak interactions between PBA and additive molecules, for example, N-alkyl-N'-carboxymethyl imidazolium bromide, beta-cyclodextrin, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, materials with various morphologies were also fabricated by a surfactant-assistant self-assembly strategy. Noteworthy is that Salvia officinalis-shaped material is among them. To the best of our knowledge, this type of microstructured material has been rarely reported. In addition, slender fibers, sphere-like particles, and aggregates of spheres were also observed. These results suggest that the rational fabrication of materials with desired shapes and sizes can be achieved by changing external environments during the self-aggregation of PBA molecules.

The soft confinement of the bilayer hydrophilic components is varied by changing hydration and bilayer composition, as well as the length of the cosurfactant polar head. Structural transitions are observed at low hydration, in the stacking order for the longer cosurfactant, and in the mixed bilayers for the shorter one. At higher hydration, the swelling of the lamellar stacks occurs with a significant, but continuous evolution in the mixed bilayer structure.

The aim is to shed light on the state of carbon and carbon-bonded moieties before thermal modifications take place during any chosen high-T treatment. Though necessary for end catalyst activation, such thermal treatments make difficult to establish a relation between the starting reactants and finally obtained catalysts. Of interest to the paper are C-13, N-15 solid-state NMR (ss-NMR) and high-resolution X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) results on a commercial carbon that was reacted first with aliphatic di- and tri-amines and then with Fe, Co ions in room-T water. Data from natural abundance ss-N-15 NMR in combination with XPS analysis were found especially relevant to assess that, in the adopted conditions, amines preferentially bind to carbon by creating alkylimino functional groups, which spontaneously form hydrous surface metal complexes with soluble Fe and Co ions.

Comparison between released and acquired charges under the form of Fe confirms that erionite binds Fe (II) by ion exchange with the extra framework (EF) cations, mainly Na. The Fe (II) binding process exhibited by both studied samples here investigated indicates a direct correlation between the extent of the ion-exchange process and the Fe (II) concentration of the solution used for fibres incubation. In the sample from Rome no further Fe (II) acquisition was observed for concentrations exceeding 500 mu M FeCl2. XPS investigation revealed that, when comparing surface and bulk composition of the samples, no Fe enrichment of the fibre surface was observed. Moreover, the location of Fe (II) within the erionite cage has been devised by combining chemical and structural data. Results highlight that, for both samples, Fe (II) is fixed at the Ca3 site being six-fold coordinated to water molecules. The occurrence of Fe (II) within the erionite cage causes a gradual migration of the other EF cations and in addition, induces a small rearrangement of the water molecules positions. It is worth mentioning that, in Fe-loaded zeolites at rather low Fe content, the Fe sites with very low nuclearity, located in well-defined crystallographic positions, represent the active sites for the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, identification of segregation of Fe (II) at Ca3, which is coupled with the high surface area of erionite, provides very important information for the understanding of the molecular mechanism/s inducing its strong carcinogenicity.

Here we use small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate iron oxide core-poly(ethylene glycol) brush shell nanoparticles with extremely high polymer grafting density. It is shown that the shell density profile can be described by a scaling model that takes into account the locally very high grafting density near the core. A good fit to a constant density region followed by a star-polymer-like, monotonously decaying density profile is shown, which could help explain the unique colloidal properties of such densely grafted core-shell nanoparticles. SAXS experiments probing the thermally induced dehydration of the shell and the response to dilution confirmed that the observed features are associated with the brush and not attributed to structure factors from particle aggregates.

In contrast, current microfabrication techniques produce static materials that do not adapt. Here, we show a fabrication process inspired by biological systems capable of adaptation. Combining the basic elements of morphogenesis, reaction and diffusion (RD), and a microvascular scaffold, we pattern microstructured materials by balancing the rates of depolymerization and inhibition of that depolymerization with a diffusive agent. As a result, the materials continuously reshape their microstructure and improve their performance. Using this system, we also recapitulate a hallmark of biological structures, formation of asymmetry from symmetric precursors.

Biopolymer pullulan is promising in manufacturing packaging films or coatings due to its excellent optical clarity, mechanical strength, and high water-solubility as compared to other biopolymers. This work aims to enhance its oxygen barrier properties and overcome its intrinsic brittleness by utilizing two-dimensional planar graphene oxide (GO) nanoplatelets. It has been found that the addition of only 0.2 wt% of GO enhanced the tensile strength, Young's modulus, and elongation at break of pullulan films by about 40, 44 and 52%, respectively. The light transmittance at 550 nm of the pullulan/GO films was 92.3% and haze values were within 3.0% threshold, which meets the general requirement for food packaging materials. In particular, the oxygen permeability coefficient of pullulan was reduced from 6337 to 2614 mL mu mm(-2) (24 h(-1)) atm(-1) with as low as 0.05 wt% of GO loading and further to 1357 mL mu mm(-2) (24 h(-1)) atm(-1) when GO concentration reached 0.3 wt%.

In this article, we have briefly discussed the recent studies that have been conducted on various anti-cancer drugs using PF127 as nano-carrier modified with other copolymers and/or conjugated with magnetic nanoparticles. The key findings of these studies demonstrated that the modified form of PF127 can significantly increase the stability of incorporated hydrophobic drugs with enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, the modified form of PF127 has also shown its therapeutic potentials as therodiagnostics in various types of tumors and cancers.

In this study, we hypothesized that the unrestricted flow control inside a chamber containing 'schools of magnetic particles' might be possible through control of an external magnetic field, biomimicking the flow generated by schools of fish. Microgels based on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and poly(acrylic acid) hydrogels were employed. With an increase in the SPION content, the microgels responded more efficiently to the translational movement of the magnetic field. Rotational movement was more efficiently achieved with anisotropic distribution of SPIONs inside microgels, which was induced by applying a magnetic field immediately prior to crosslinking. The systems of the anisotropic microgels successfully provided microflow for effective mixing in a capillary. This biomimetic flow control may be useful for the control of fluid systems of any micro- or nano-size and any shape, regardless of the tortuosity.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Electrospun copper oxide nanofibers as infrared photodetectors", "Abstract": "Copper oxide (CuO) nanofibers (NFs) were synthesized in the form of dense mesh via electrospinning technique and evaluated as infrared (IR) photodetectors.

The pretreatments are shown to modify polysaccharides and lignin content to enhance the accessibility for cellulase enzymes. The highest increase in the cellulose accessibility was observed in dilute sodium hydroxide, followed by methods using ammonia soaking and lime (Ca(OH)(2)). The biggest increase of cellulose accessibility occurs during the first 10 min of pretreatment, with further increases at a slower rate as severity increases. Low temperature ammonia soaking at longer residence times dissolved a major portion of hemicellulose and exhibited higher cellulose accessibility than high temperature soaking. Moreover, the most significant reduction of degree of polymerization (DP) occurred for dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and ammonia pre-treated Populus samples.

Critical growth ratios for the triggering of creases or detachment from the contacting boundary have been investigated both analytically and numerically. Results show that compressive residual stresses induced by confined growth of the tubular tissue can lead to a variety of surface folding patterns which strongly depend on the thickness of the tube. In a thick tube creases begin to form at the inner surface of the tube and in a thin tube the structure detaches from the confining wall. Between these two extremes there is a transitional area wherein the tube starts to crease at first and then detaches from the confining wall. Further modeling reveals that a gap between the tube and the confinement can tune the shape evolution of the growing biological tube.

The compressive response of foams developed from these materials is currently a primary criterion for the material development. In this work, we focus on the connection between the non-linear part of the response and the inner structure of the material. We study the effect of internal contact and its contribution to gradual stiffening in the energy absorbing region and accelerated stiffening in the densification region of the large strain compressive response. We use the finite element method in this study and discuss the applicability and efficiency of different modelling techniques by considering well defined geometries and available experimental data. The relative contribution of internal contact is singled out and mapped onto the overall compressive response of the material. The effect of initial non-straightness of the cell walls is studied through superposing differing percentages of the buckling modes on the initial geometry. The initial non-straightness is seen to have a significant effect for only strains up to 1%. The secant modulus measured at slightly higher strains of 4%, demonstrates lesser effect from the non-straightness of cell walls. The simulations capture the compressive response well into the densification regime and there is an order of magnitude agreement in between simulations and experiments.

In this study, electrocoagulation-flotation (ECF) was employed to harvest microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris). Higher current density achieved higher collection efficiency, but also resulted in higher energy consumption and increased levels of dissolved aluminium. At the same ratio of current density to initial cell density, collection efficiency decreased from 99.0% of 0.24 g L-1 to 30.5% of 1.17 g L-1 when the electrolysis time was 20 min. For stirring and aeration, the highest collection efficiency was 98.4%, obtained by stirring at 50 rpm for 20 min. This efficiency was nearly equal to the highest collection efficiency for aeration: 98.3% for 50 mL min(-1) aeration at 30 min. Acidic and neutral culture conditions were beneficial due to the positively charged aluminium species in the culture; higher collection efficiencies (more than 98%) occurred with pH levels of 5-7 after 20 min. The lowest energy consumption of 0.61 kW h kg(-1) was achieved at pH 5.

However, we have not yet found a satisfactory solution to these problems. Wasteheat recovery is considered to be one of the best solutions because it can improve energy efficiency by converting heat exhausted from plants and machinery to electric power. This technology would also prevent atmospheric temperature increases caused by waste heat, and decrease fossil fuel consumption by recovering heat energy, thus also reducing CO2 emissions. The system proposed in this research generates electric power by providing waste heat or unharnessed thermal energy to built-in thermoelectric modules that can convert heat into electric power. Waste heat can be recovered from many places, including machinery in industrial plants, piping in electric power plants, waste incineration plants, and so on. Some natural heat sources such as hot springs and solar heat can also be used for this thermoelectric generation system. The generated power is expected to be supplied to auxiliary machinery around the heat source, stored as an emergency power supply, and so on. The attributes of this system are (1) direct power generation using hot springs or waste heat; (2) 24-h stable power generation; (3) stand-alone power system with no noise and no vibration; and (4) easy maintenance attributed to its simple structure with no moving parts. In order to maximize energy use efficiency, the temperature difference between both sides of the thermoelectric (TE) modules built into the system need to be kept as large as possible. This means it is important to reduce thermal resistance between TE modules and heat source. Moreover, the system's efficiency greatly depends on the base temperature of the heat sources and the material of the system's TE modules. Therefore, in order to make this system practical and efficient, it is necessary to choose the heat source first and then design the most appropriate structure for the source by applying analytical methods.

Based on the protonic-conductivity mechanism of gelatin, a novel organic conductive filler with high dielectric constant and low elastic modulus was prepared by mixing gelatin and glycerol (GG). The separated structured DE was prepared by spraying a solution of GG into the multiple layers of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (TPU) nonwoven fabric by electrospinning, followed by hot pressing under vacuum. The densely packed TPU nonwoven fabric not only ensures the good mechanical strength of GG/TPU DE, but also separates GG filler and stops the formation of the GG continuous phase, preventing the formation of a conducting path under an exerted electric field. The novel GG filler considerably increases the dielectric constant and decreases the elastic modulus of the GG/TPU DE. As a result, the as-prepared DE exhibits good mechanical strength and 5.2% actuation strain at a very low electric field (0.5 kV mm(-1)). To the best of our knowledge, the required electric field for the same actuation strain is the lowest compared to other DE reported in the literature.

Moreover, their smaller specific surface can help to reduce the surface energy and thus prevent the nanofillers from agglomerating in the polymer matrix. The ceramic-polymer composites consisting of SrTiO3 nanofibers (ST NF) with a large aspect ratio prepared via electrospinning and modified by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as fillers and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as matrix have been fabricated by a solution casting method.

The highest fibre strength and toughness were obtained for fibres with an average diameter of 1.0 mu m, 62.5 MPa and 65.8 MJ m(-3), respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fibres showed a skewed amorphous halo, whereas the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results revealed an apparent crystallinity of 6-8% for the 0.4 and 1 mu m fibres and 0.2% crystallinity for the 4.3 mu m fibres. Heat shrinkage experiments were conducted by exposing the fibres to a temperature above their glass transition temperature (T-g). The test revealed a remarkable capability of the thinnest fibres to shrink by 50%, which was in contrast to the 4.3 mu m fibres, which displayed only 4% shrinkage. These thinner fibres aka showed a significantly higher glass transition temperature (+15 degrees C) than that of the 4.3 mu m fibres. The results suggested an internal morphology with a high degree of molecular orientation in the amorphous segments along the thinner fibres, consistent with a constrained mesomorphic phase formed during their rapid solidification in the electric field. Air filtration was demonstrated with cigarette smoke as a model substance passed through the fibre mats. The 0.4 mu m fibres showed the most effective smoke filtration and a capacity to absorb 43x its own weight in smoke residuals. whereas the 1 mu m fibres showed the best combination of filtration capacity (32x) and mechanical robustness.

Therefore, a thorough understanding of how a lipid membrane responds to the introduction of rotating NPs is quite important to promote the applications of this technique in a variety of biomedical area. Here, we performed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations to systematically investigate the interaction mechanism between lipid membranes and rotating NPs. Two kinds of membrane responses are observed. One is the promoted cell uptake and the other is the mechanical membrane rupture. The promoting effect of NP rotation on the cell uptake is ascribed to the enhanced membrane monolayer protrusion, which can wrap the NP from the top side. Meanwhile, the rotating NP exerts a shearing force on the membrane. Accordingly, the membrane undergoes a local distortion around the NP. If the shearing force exceeds a critical value, the local membrane distortion develops into a mechanical rupture. A number of factors, like NP size, NP shape, ligand density and rotation speed, are critical in both of the above membrane responses.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Temperature and pressure tuneable swollen bicontinuous cubic phases approaching nature's length scales", "Abstract": "Bicontinuous cubic structures offer enormous potential in applications ranging from protein crystallisation to drug delivery systems and have been observed in cellular membrane structures.

Possible options to control environmental impacts associated with consumption of natural resources include the introduction of easier way to identify the consumption of natural resources and the associated environmental impacts through the global supply chain, and the establishment of sound material cycle to reduce the consumption of national resources. Nickel and nickel-containing materials, whose global demand has risen rapidly in recent years, play a crucial role in modern society, with uses in numerous types of infrastructure and technology. At the same time, the life cycles of nickel-containing materials are always associated with environmental risks and challenges (Nakajima et al. 2014). Especially, the environmental impacts caused by nickel mining has received particular attention in recent years, because the world's leading countries and regions of nickel ore production (e.g., New Caledonia, Philippines and the Republic of Indonesia) are also typically known as biodiversity hotspots (Myers et al. 2000). However, we can see material and/or quality losses of nickel throughout anthropogenic nickel cycle (Reck and Graedel 2012). Possible options to reduce the environmental impacts associated with nickel mining include nickel recovery from wastes such as spent batteries and catalysts, plating sewage, and industrial water. Recovery of these wastes has a potential to reduce natural resource consumption, and to reduce a negative impact on the environment and human health if they contaminate soil, water, and air. In this study, we discussed a bottleneck for establishing sound material cycle of nickel. Hence, upon assessing the generation and processing of nickel-containing wastes, we clarify the quality of nickel-containing waste, as well as the technical bottlenecks for closing the loop on the material cycle of nickel. Sound material cycle of nickel-containing steel scrap has been established in Japan; with reports of almost of nickel-based stainless scrap being recycled (Daigo et al. 2010). Therefore, this study addressed nickel-containing waste that are of particular concern for losses, such as pre-consumer materials with low-grade nickel content. This study identified characteristics of nickel containing pre-consumer materials generated from steel production industry (stainless steel), electrodepositing tool production industry, edible oils and fats industry, and nickel plating industry.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Impedance Spectroscopy Study of Carbon Nanotube-Glass Microfiber Composites", "Abstract": "The method of fabricating composites composed of a glass microfiber matrix and the conductive nanofibers is proposed.

Herein, amorphous carbon material was fabricated through direct pyrolysis of low-cost pitch and phenolic resin at heat treatment temperatures between 1200 and 1600 degrees C. The electrochemical performances of the amorphous carbon were systematically investigated in SIBs with in expensive Al foil as current collector and environmentally benign aqueous sodium alginate as binder. By optimizing the carbonization temperature and precursor, we achieved an initial Coulombic efficiency of 88% - the highest reported so far for carbon- based anodes in SIBs with a high reversible capacity of 284mA hg(-1) and excellent cycling performance. It was found that both the carbonization temperature and the mass ratio of pitch to phenolic resin have significant impact on the local structure of amorphous carbon, which leads to various electrochemical behaviors.

It is also thought to play a key role in cell signaling processes associated with functional plasma membrane microdomains (domains enriched in cholesterol), commonly referred to as rafts. In all of these diverse biological phenomena, the transverse location of cholesterol in the membrane is almost certainly an important structural feature. Using a combination of neutron scattering and solid-state H-2 NMR, we have determined the location and orientation of cholesterol in phosphatidylcholine (PC) model membranes having fatty acids of different lengths and degrees of unsaturation. The data establish that cholesterol reorients rapidly about the bilayer normal in all the membranes studied, but is tilted and forced to span the bilayer midplane in the very thin bilayers. The possibility that cholesterol lies flat in the middle of bilayers, including those made from PC lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is ruled out.

The combination of cationic nanoparticles in suspension and anionic starch in solution gave rise to aggregate formation which was studied by dynamic light scattering, revealing the initial adsorption of the starch molecules on the particle surface. By examining the stability ratio, W, it was found that even in the most destabilized state, i.e. at charge neutralization, the starch chains had induced steric stabilization to the system. At higher particle and starch concentrations relaxation of the aggregates could be seen, as monitored by a decrease in turbidity with time. This relaxation was evaluated by fitting the data to the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts function. It was found that irrespective of the starch to particle charge ratio the relaxation time was similar. Moreover, a molecular weight dependence on the relaxation time was found, as well as a more pronounced initial aggregated state for the higher molecular weight starch. This initial aggregate state could be due to bridging flocculation. With time, as the starch chains have relaxed into a final conformation on the particle surface, bridging will be less important and is gradually replaced by patches that will cause patchwise flocculation. After an equilibration time no molecular weight dependence on aggregation could be seen, which confirms the patchwise flocculation mechanism.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Ion pairing controls rheological properties of \"processionary'' polyelectrolyte hydrogels", "Abstract": "We demonstrated recently that polyelectrolytes with cationic moieties along the chain and a single anionic head are able to form physical hydrogels due to the reversible nature of the head-to-body ionic bond.

However, the integration of macromolecules, such as PSII, into hybrid bio-electrodes is often plagued by poor electrical wiring between the protein guest and the material host. Here, we report a new benchmark PSII-electrode system that combines the efficient wiring afforded by redox-active polymers with the high loading provided by hierarchically-structured inverse opal indium tin oxide (IO-ITO) electrodes. Compared to flat electrodes, the hierarchical IO-ITO electrodes enabled up to an approximately 50-fold increase in the immobilisation of an Os complex-modified and a phenothiazine-modified polymer. When the Os complex-modified polymer is co-adsorbed with PSII on the hierarchical electrodes, photocurrent densities of up to similar to 410 mu A cm(-2) at 0.5 V vs. SHE were observed in the absence of diffusional mediators, demonstrating a substantially improved wiring of PSII to the IO-ITO electrode with the redox polymer.

Photocatalytic degradation of phenazopyridine (PAP) as a model pharmaceutical contaminant was investigated using TiO2 nanofibers and hybrid PEDOT infused TiO2 nanofibers. A novel material of PEDOT infused TiO2 nanofibers was fabricated via electrospinning and calcination to form TiO2 followed by the introduction of PEDOT using vapor phase polymerization. By changing the calcination temperature, the phase composition in TiO2 nanofibers can be adjusted to pure anatase phase, mixed phase and pure rutile phase. The photocatalytic activities of TiO2 nanofibers before and after PEDOT polymerization were measured by monitoring the decreasing concentration of PAP in aqueous solution under UV illumination using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. PEDOT infused TiO2 nanofibers showed an improved photocatalytic performance compared to their non-PEDOT infused counterparts for the degradation of PAP. This improvement can be attributed to the introduction of hole transport layer of PEDOT leading to an enhanced hole transfer from the TiO2 nanofibers to PEDOT. PEDOT infused rutile nanofiber has the most degradation enhancement (125%) compared to other two types of fibers (70% for PEDOT infused anatase & 30% for PEDOT infused mixed-phase).", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Facile reduction of para-nitrophenols: catalytic efficiency of silver nanoferns in batch and continuous flow reactors", "Abstract": "The catalytic efficiency of silver-nanoferns (Ag-NFs) decorated on carbon microfiber surfaces has been investigated.

A force sensor was indigenously designed to study the piezoelectric responses of the nanocomposite nanofibers. At 10 wt% of HNT loading, the sensor produced the highest voltage output, which can be ascribed to its highest beta-phase content.

The electrospun PCL-PEI nanofibers are chemically conjugated with multivalent poly(ethyeleneglycol) (PEG) chains, and PEI is chemically tethered to the PEG layers in order to further decorate the surface with multiple layers of PEG. The layered PEG is characterized using both thermal properties and direct visualization of the whole mats with fluorescence labeling, which exhibit escalating levels of PEG content with increasing numbers of PEG layering processes. The PCL-PEI nanofibers with PEG multilayers exhibit superior water swelling rates compared with unmodified mats and have high water retaining behaviors for prolonged periods without additional water supply in a PEG layer-dependent manner. When epidermal cells are cultivated on the PEG-multilayered mats without a continuous supply of the cell culture medium, the viability is maintained for 48 h and gradually decreases after 48 h. The epidermis-specific genes are highly expressed in cells cultivated on the PEG-multilayered mats in comparison with those on an insert well or unmodified mats, which is confirmed by qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemical staining of total keratin.

Here, the system of hybrid bilayers was comprised of sodium alginate (SA)/graphene oxide (GO) and polyethylenimine (PEI), in which SA and GO were held together by the combination of electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding in a common solution. Firstly, GO coated FPU foams were prepared by alternately submerging FPU foams into SA/GO suspension and PEI solution. Subsequently, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) coated FPU foams were prepared by the thermal reduction of GO based multilayer films at a temperature of 180 degrees C. The results of thermogravimetric analysis showed that RGO coated FPU foams have higher thermal stability than that of GO coated FPU foams in the temperature range from 430 to 600 degrees C. The results of cone calorimeter testing indicated that all coated FPU foams have lower peak heat release rate, peak smoke production rate and total smoke production compared with that of the pristine FPU foam. The \"delayed effect\" in heat release rate and smoke production rate was observed for coated FPU foams with high bilayers number (>3), revealing that graphene material based multilayer films have excellent physical barrier effect.

This quality can be used in water purification by applying nanotechnology. As our study suggests, the adsorption behavior of engineered ferritin strongly resembles that of ferrihydrite (Fh) which is in nature the most insoluble and stable Fe (hydr) oxide at the nanoscale due to its exceptionally low surface Gibbs free energy. For freshly prepared Fh, the adsorption of phosphate has been measured and modeled as a function of pH (4-11), solution concentration (mu M-mM), and background electrolyte level (0.01-1 M). In connection to surface complexation modeling (SCM) the surface structure of Fh has been analyzed, quantifying the unique polyhedral surface composition with singly coordinated surface groups that may form either monodentate or bidentate surface complexes. The spherical double layer theory has been implemented for downscaling to very small cluster sizes, which is vital for studying nanoparticle behavior in natural as well as synthetic systems. Modeling suggests the formation of very small Fh clusters when particles are produced in the absence of Ftn by instantaneous Fe.III) neutralization, leading at pH 7 on average to 62 +/- 3 Fe per particle with a solubility product of logQ(so) = -37.3 +/- 0.2. The corresponding size of the critical nucleus (n(Fe) = 11 +/- 2) matches well with the smallest imaginable Fh cluster with a Fe-13 Keggin structure. Application of the model to engineered ferritin (Ftn) suggests that in the initial step of preparation, more than one Fe (hydr) oxide cluster per ferritin can be formed, having a very small size (n(Fe) similar to 17). The initial clusters, metastable in Ftn, can grow at stepwise additions of Fe and will fuse to a large singlet above similar to 1000 Fe per Ftn. However, the clusters remain very small (similar to 20 +/- 5 Fe) when Ftn is loaded with Fe in the presence of PO4. These ultra-small clusters are stabilized by the adsorption of PO4 (similar to 5-10 PO4 per cluster) that decreases the surface Gibbs free energy (G(surf)). At a large decrease in G(surf) due to ion adsorption, Fe-oxyanion networks will form that can be important in terrestrial and aquatic systems.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Carboxylation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes reduces their toxicity in primary human alveolar macrophages", "Abstract": "Surface functionalisation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) is commonly used to facilitate their various and diverse applications. Inhaled nanomaterials, such as MWCNTs, have a high deposition rate in the alveolar units of the deep lung, where alveolar macrophages (AM) provide the front line of cellular immune defence by removing foreign matter (microbes, particles etc.). The toxicity of MWCNTs (with or without functionalisation) towards primary human AMs is not known. We investigated the physicochemical characteristics and toxicity of two MWCNT materials: acid purified Purified-MWCNT' and concentrated acid functionalised COOH-MWCNT'. We hypothesised that the bioreactivity with primary human AM would differ between the materials. Full characterisation of the MWCNTs revealed that -COOH functionalisation yielded shorter MWCNTs, accompanied by a greater occurrence of framework defects, in comparison to Purified-MWCNT. In agreement with our hypothesis that the bioreactivity would differ, Purified-MWCNT were significantly more toxic as measured by reduced cell viability and increased inflammatory mediator release. For example, IL-1 beta and IL-8 release by AMs significantly increased 3.5-and 2.4 fold, respectively (P < 0.05), 24 hours after treatment with Purified-MWCNT. In contrast, IL-1 beta and IL-8 release by AMs did not significantly change 24 hours after treatment with COOH-MWCNT. We determined that the mechanism of this toxicity is likely due to activation of the inflammasome, as lipopolysaccharide priming of primary human AMs was necessary to see the inflammatory response and this was accompanied by lysosomal disruption and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. This study contributes further to our understanding of the effects of MWCNTs and surface modification on highly relevant human lung AMs; the findings have important implications for the manufacture, application and use of MWCNTs. In particular, this is relevant where applications prefer biocompatible MWCNTs.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Effects of natural organic matter and sulfidation on the flocculation and filtration of silver nanoparticles", "Abstract": "Surface properties of engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are strongly affected by environmental transformation. The fate and transport of these transformed AgNPs is largely unknown and cannot be fully explained by the traditional Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the composition and surface properties of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped AgNPs after environmental transformation and their subsequent effects on the flocculation and filtration of these transformed AgNPs during water treatment processes. To study the aggregation and deposition behavior of the transformed particles, PVP-AgNPs exposed to humic acid (HA) and/or sulfidation were characterized, followed by separate flocculation, granular media filtration, and quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM) experiments. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that HA exposure modified the original PVP capping via adsorption and/or ligand exchange and that sulfidation stripped the PVP from the particle surface as a result of the formation of silver sulfide. Sulfidation thereby reduced the stability of PVP-AgNPs in self-aggregation but enhanced the mobility of AgNPs in granular media filtration and quartz collector deposition. Without unbound macromolecules in the background solution, polymers on the particle surface largely prevent self-aggregation but allow favorable clean bed deposition. This difference between the effects on self-aggregation and granular media filtration is in contrast to traditional DLVO theory. QCM yielded two types of results, the initial rate of deposition and the ultimate deposition, and both gave insights into expected filtration behavior.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Sustainable CNT-enabled lithium-ion battery manufacturing: evaluating the tradeoffs", "Abstract": "A stochastic goal programming model is developed to aid decision making for CNT-enabled lithium-ion battery manufacturing production and capacity expansion, by considering the balance among economic growth, environmental and human health protection, and sustainability.

Small-size lipid tubes are, however, very difficult to allocate or align in the vertical direction on the specific site of the substrate and, therefore, the ability to produce them selectively and in large quantities as an array form is limited. Herein, we propose an easy and novel method to fabricate selective and vertical lipid tube arrays using template-guided gentle hydration of dried lipid films without any external forces. A lipid solution was drop-dispensed onto a porous membrane and dried to form a lipid film. Then, the lipid-coated porous membrane was transferred to a glass substrate by using a UV-cured polymer layer to achieve tight bonding. Upon swelling with an appropriate buffer, expansion forces due to osmotic pressure during the gentle hydration process were highly constrained to confined pores, thereby resulting in the nucleation of tube-like lipid structures through the pores. Interestingly, according to the aspect ratio of pores (AR(pore), pore length/pore diameter), different shapes of lipid structures, including vesicular, oval, and tube-like, were generated, which indicates the importance of the ARpore, as well as the pore diameter, during fabrication of tubular lipid structures. Also, this approach was easily modified with 1% chitosan to enhance the stability of the lipid tubes (>30 min in life time), by lipid coating twice and by using unsaturated lipids to increase tube length (>30 mu m in length).

The methods of salt damage treatment are assessed then, including both passive techniques based on environmental control, reduction of water transport, or conversion to less soluble salts and active procedures resulting in the removal of salts from deterioration zones. It is concluded that cellulose can still be considered as the favorite material presently used in desalination poultices but hydrophilic mineral wool can serve as its prospective alternative in future applications.

Some heavy metals such as copper, at trace levels, are indispensable to preserve the metabolism of the human body. The application of the electrochemical methods (potentiometric and impedimetric) for Cu detection are simple and low cost with short detection times. One of the most important challenges in sensors development is how to increase sensibility and the obtained the best detection limit. The aim of this work is to investigate and compare two different types of electrochemical (potentiometric and impedimetric) methods for detection of Cu2+ ions in aqueous solution using chitosan-gold nanoparticles (CS-AuNPs) membrane. Methods: CS-AuNPs membrane has been prepared by adding of AuNPs obtained using Turkevich method to the CS dispersed in the acid acetic solution. Potentiometric and impedimetric measurements were performed using a graphite-epoxy electrode modified by CS-AuNPs membrane in aqueous solution in the concentration range of 10(-9) to 10(-1) M of Cu(NO3)(2). Results: For the first time, the relation between percolation threshold and detection limit of copper ions has been established. The best detection limit in both methods has been observed when the concentration of AuNPs is near the percolation threshold. Obtained results show that potentiometric method has a detection limit of 2.36 x 10(-5) and a linear response range between 2.36 x 10(-5) and 4 x 10(-2) M of Cu2+.

The hierarchical architecture of the C@SnO2@C nanofiber bundle guaranteed a good match between the electron transport kinetics and the Li+ diffusion kinetics, thus realizing efficient ambipolar diffusion. Another merit that originated from the configuration of the C@SnO2@C nanofiber bundle was the unique \"breath\" behavior, which effectively accommodated the volume change of SnO2 so as to ensure structural integrity with the formation of the smooth and thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI).

The resulting ethylenediamine-modified lysozyme nanofibers, which have higher net positive charges as a result of the reduction in the number of -COO- groups through ethylenediamine conjugations, can adsorb Cr(VI) (existing as negatively charged chromate) rapidly in water and have stronger Cr(VI) adsorption capacity in acidic, neutral and alkaline media (pH 3.0-11.0) compared to unmodified lysozyme nanofibers. Results of the Langmuir isotherm model reveal that the adsorption sites on modified lysozyme nanofibers have higher affinity for Cr(VI) with respect to those on unmodified lysozyme nanofibers. Ethylenediamine-modified lysozyme nanofibers can maintain their Cr(VI) removal efficiency (similar to 60%) after undergoing a series of desorption steps using NaCl as the desorbing agent. Ethylenediamine/-COO- conjugations can increase the adsorption capacities of lysozyme nanofibers for Cr(VI) in industrial wastewater (q(e) = 0.68 mg g(-1)) and river water (q(e) = 1.90 mg g(-1)) compared to those of unmodified lysozyme nanofibers (q(e) = 0.40 and 1.44 mg g(-1) for industrial wastewater and river water, respectively).", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Degradation of disperse blue 2BLN by oleaginous C. sorokiniana XJK", "Abstract": "In this study, an oil-producing freshwater microalgae Chlorella sorokiniana XJK was identified and used for the degradation of disperse blue 2BLN.

The calcination of Upsalite at 250 degrees C, which removes organic groups present in the uncalcined material, is found to significantly affect the behavior of adsorbed water. The proportion of free to bound water is considerably higher in the calcined material as compared to the uncalcined counterpart for relative humidities above similar to 80%. The amount of free water in calcined Upsalite remains high even when the relative humidity is subsequently decreased and is the most likely cause of crystallization of the material into nesquehonite upon high humidity storage. In chorus, the presence of organic groups in uncalcined Upalite most likely accounts for the higher binding degree of adsorbed water and, thus, the less likelihood of water-induced crystallization of this version of the material. Two dielectric relaxation processes were observed in calcined Upsalite and were attributed to a Maxwell-Wagner and a Stern-layer relaxation process. The presented results create a fundamental understanding of water interaction properties in the novel mesoporous magnesium carbonate material Upsalite and are expected to facilitate optimization of the stability of the material while simultaneously ensuring the lack of toxic surface groups-properties of importance for novel drug formulations and other life-science applications.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Efficient Exciton Diffusion and Resonance-Energy Transfer in Multilayered Organic Epitaxial Nanofibers", "Abstract": "Multilayered epitaxial nanofibers are exemplary model systems for the study of exciton dynamics and lasing in organic materials because of their well-defined morphology, high luminescence efficiencies, and color tunability.

The activation energy for exciton diffusion in p6P is determined to be as low as 19 meV, proving p6P epitaxial layers also as a very suitable donor material system. The small activation energy for exciton diffusion of the p6P donor material, the inferred high p6P-to-6T resonance-energy-transfer efficiency, and the observed weak PL temperature dependence of the 6T acceptor material together result in an exceptionally high optical emission performance of this all-organic material system, thus making it well suited, for example, for organic light-emitting devices.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Thermal energy storage - overview and specific insight into nitrate salts for sensible and latent heat storage", "Abstract": "Thermal energy storage (TES) is capable to reduce the demand of conventional energy sources for two reasons: First, they prevent the mismatch between the energy supply and the power demand when generating electricity from renewable energy sources.

For this purpose, a highly efficient tubular dielectric barrier discharge reactor is built to allow the continuous treatment of \"endless\" cylindrical substrates. The best treatment conditions found regarding adhesion are Ar/O-2 plasma pretreatment, followed by the deposition from dichloromethane of a 75 nm-thick organo-chlorinated plasma polymerized thin film. Ar/O-2, pretreatment allows the removal of organic residues, coming from drawing lubricants, and induces external growth of zinc oxide. The plasma layer has to be preferably deposited at low power to conserve sufficient hydrocarbon moieties. Surface analyses reveal the complex chemical mechanism behind the establishment of strong adhesion levels, more than five times higher after the plasma treatment. During the vulcanization step, superficial ZnO reacts with the chlorinated species of the thin film and is converted into porous and granular bump-shaped ZnwOxHyClz nanostructures. Together, rubber additives diffuse through the plasma layer and lead to the formation of zinc sulfide on the substrate surface.

To maintain a high activity of immobilized nanocatalysts, it is critically important to design an interface that minimizes the contact area and favors reaction chemistry. Here we report on the application of mussel-inspired adhesion chemistry to the formation of catalytic metal nanocrystal-polydopamine hybrid materials that exhibit a high catalytic efficiency during recycled uses. Electrospun polymer nanofibers are used as a template for in situ formation and immobilization of gold nanoparticles via polydopamine-induced reduction of ionic precursors.

However, they usually work in acidic conditions and thus impede their real applications. In this work, by modulating the nanostructure, composition, and surface property of the bimetallic materials, the positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium)-stabilized Au@.Ag heterogeneous nanorods.(NRs) were developed as synergistic peroxidase-like interfaces, which exhibited high activity over a wide pH range (pH 4.0-6.5) using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as the chromogenic substrate. At pH 6.5, the peroxidase-like activity for the Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs was stable and optimal within 20-40 degrees C. Moreover, the Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs showed excellent temperature stability and long-term storage stability. Given these characters, the detection of H2O2 at pH 6.5 was proposed on the basis of the Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs catalyzing the colorimetric reaction of H2O2 and ABTS, where the oxidized ABTS showed a typical absorption peak at 414 nm. The absorbance at 414 nrn was linear with H2O2 concentration from 0.01 to 10 mM. Further, considering that Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs and glucose wddase (GOx) have similar optimal pH for catalytic activities, a novel one-pot method for the detection of glucose was developed by the coupled catalytic reaction using GOx, Au@Ag heterogeneous NRs, and ABTS at nearly neutral pH (pH 6.5) and 37 degrees C. This proposed method had simple and rapid processes, wide linear range (0.05-20 mM), and reliability for the successful analysis of real samples.

Compared with alkyl terminals, pi-systems can form pi-pi arrangements, for example, with an aligning spherical fullerene pi-system. To study the effects of two kinds of terminals on the solar cell performance, the non-alkyl, branched aromatic and electron-donating diphenylamine (DPA) and the aliphatic n-butyl (n-Bu) unit are selected as end-capping groups on a diketopyrrolo-pyrrole-based linear backbone, affording two new solution-processable small-molecule donors. Photovoltaic data indicate that by changing the end-function from n-Bu to DPA, the photocurrent significantly increases from 8.35 to 15.64 mA cm(-2) and the efficiency from 3.2 to 5.8%. Characterization of absorption, morphology, recombination, and carrier transportation clearly demonstrates that the higher photocurrent can be attributed to a higher density of the mobile carriers (i.e., free holes, in this case). The DPA end-functions enhance the light-harvesting capacity, improve the charge dissociation, and reduce the recombination loss, all of which lead to more carriers being collected by the electrode. This work demonstrates that the choice of end-function along the molecular backbone is as important to improve the cell performance as the light-harvesting backbone and the side-chains.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "A Peptide-Coated Gold Nanocluster Exhibits Unique Behavior in Protein Activity Inhibition", "Abstract": "Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) can be primed for biomedical applications through functionalization with peptide coatings. Often anchored by thiol groups, such peptide coronae not only serve as passivators but can also endow AuNCs with additional bioactive properties. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure of a tridecapeptide-coated Au-25 cluster and its subsequent interactions with the enzyme thioredoxin reductase 1, TrxR1. We find that, in isolation, both the distribution and conformation of the coating peptides fluctuate considerably. When the coated AuNC is placed around TrxR1, however, the motion of the highly charged peptide coating (+5e/peptide) is quickly biased by electrostatic attraction to the protein; the asymmetric coating acts to guide the nanocluster's diffusion toward the enzythe's negatively charged active site. After the AuNC comes into contact with TrxR1, its peptide corona spreads over the protein surface to facilitate stable binding with protein. Though individual salt bridge interactions between the tridecapeptides and TrxR1 are transient in nature, the cooperative binding of the peptide-coated AuNC is very stable, overall. Interestingly, the biased corona peptide motion, the spreading and the cooperation between peptide extensions observed in AuNC binding are reminiscent of bacterial stimulus-driven approaching and adhesion mechanisms mediated by cilia. The prevailing AuNC binding mode we characterize also satisfies a notable hydrophobic interaction seen in the association of thioredoxin to TrxR1, providing a possible explanation for the AuNC binding specificity observed in experiments. Our simulations thus suggest this peptide-coated AuNC serves as an adept thioredoxin mimic that extends an array of auxiliary structural components capable of enhancing interactions with the target protein in question.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Gamma Peptide Nucleic Acids: As Orthogonal Nucleic Acid Recognition Codes for Organizing Molecular Self-Assembly", "Abstract": "Nucleic acids are an attractive platform for organizing molecular self-assembly because of their specific nucleobase interactions and defined length scale.

The concentrated pomegranate peel extract (PGE-C) was the richest in phenols (66.97 g gallic acid equivalents/kg) while the concentrated sumac extract from fruits (SUF-C) showed the highest anthocyanin amount (171.96 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalents/kg). Both phenolic and anthocyanin profile of pomegranate and sumac extracts were quite different: pomegranate extract was rich in cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside and ellagic acid derivatives, while sumac extract was characterized by 7-methyl-cyanidin 3-galactoside and gallic acid derivatives. The concentrated extracts from both pomegranate peel and sumac leaves significantly reduced the development of Botrytis rots. In particular, the extract from pomegranate peel completely inhibited the pathogen at different intervals of time (0, 12, and 24 h) between treatment and pathogen inoculation on fruits maintained at 22-24 degrees C and high relative humidity (RH).

NMR signals of the OB-fold domain of detergent-solubilized PH0471 are observed because of the flexibility of the linker region. In this study, the linker region was substituted with target IDPs. Fifty-three candidates were selected using the prediction tool POODLE and 35 expression vectors were constructed. Subsequently, we obtained N-15-labeled chimeric PH0471 proteins with 25 IDPs as linkers. The NMR spectra allowed us to classify IDPs into three categories: flexible, moderately flexible, and inflexible. The inflexible IDPs contain membrane-associating or aggregation-prone sequences. This is the first attempt to use an indirect/reflected NMR method to evaluate IDPs and can verify the predictions derived from our computational tools.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Plant MYB Transcription Factors: Their Role in Drought Response Mechanisms", "Abstract": "Water scarcity is one of the major causes of poor plant performance and limited crop yields worldwide and it is the single most common cause of severe food shortage in developing countries. Several molecular networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction and stress responses in plants have been elucidated so far. Transcription factors are major players in water stress signaling. In recent years, different MYB transcription factors, mainly in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. but also in some crops, have been characterized for their involvement in drought response. For some of them there is evidence supporting a specific role in response to water stress, such as the regulation of stomatal movement, the control of suberin and cuticular waxes synthesis and the regulation of flower development. Moreover, some of these genes have also been characterized for their involvement in other abiotic or biotic stresses, an important feature considering that in nature, plants are often simultaneously subjected to multiple rather than single environmental perturbations. This review summarizes recent studies highlighting the role of the MYB family of transcription factors in the adaptive responses to drought stress. The practical application value of MYBs in crop improvement, such as stress tolerance engineering, is also discussed.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Chromium-Induced Ultrastructural Changes and Oxidative Stress in Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana", "Abstract": "Chromium (Cr) is an abundant heavy metal in nature, toxic to living organisms. As it is widely used in industry and leather tanning, it may accumulate locally at high concentrations, raising concerns for human health hazards. Though Cr effects have extensively been investigated in animals and mammals, in plants they are poorly understood. The present study was then undertaken to determine the ultrastructural malformations induced by hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], the most toxic form provided as 100 M potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), in the root tip cells of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A concentration-dependent decrease of root growth and a time-dependent increase of dead cells, callose deposition, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and peroxidase activity were found in Cr(VI)-treated seedlings, mostly at the transition root zone. In the same zone, nuclei remained ultrastructurally unaffected, but in the meristematic zone some nuclei displayed bulbous outgrowths or contained tubular structures. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was less affected under Cr(VI) stress, but Golgi bodies appeared severely disintegrated. Moreover, mitochondria and plastids became spherical and displayed translucent stroma with diminished internal membranes, but noteworthy is that their double-membrane envelopes remained structurally intact. Starch grains and electron dense deposits occurred in the plastids. Amorphous material was also deposited in the cell walls, the middle lamella and the vacuoles. Some vacuoles were collapsed, but the tonoplast appeared integral. The plasma membrane was structurally unaffected and the cytoplasm contained opaque lipid droplets and dense electron deposits. All electron dense deposits presumably consisted of Cr that is sequestered from sensitive sites, thus contributing to metal tolerance. It is concluded that the ultrastructural changes are reactive oxygen species (ROS)-correlated and the malformations observed are organelle specific.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "14-3-3 gamma Regulates Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammatory Responses and Lactation in Dairy Cow Mammary Epithelial Cells by Inhibiting NF-kappa B and MAPKs and Up-Regulating mTOR Signaling", "Abstract": "As a protective factor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury, 14-3-3 gamma has been the subject of recent research. Nevertheless, whether 14-3-3 gamma can regulate lactation in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells (DCMECs) induced by LPS remains unknown. Here, the anti-inflammatory effect and lactation regulating ability of 14-3-3 gamma in LPS-induced DCMECs are investigated for the first time, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for their effects are explored. The results of qRT-PCR showed that 14-3-3 gamma overexpression significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis revealed that 14-3-3 gamma overexpression also suppressed the production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in cell culture supernatants. Meanwhile, CASY-TT Analyser System showed that 14-3-3 gamma overexpression clearly increased the viability and proliferation of cells. The results of kit methods and western blot analysis showed that 14-3-3 gamma overexpression promoted the secretion of triglycerides and lactose and the synthesis of beta-casein. Furthermore, the expression of genes relevant to nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) and lactation-associated proteins were assessed by western blot, and the results suggested that 14-3-3 gamma overexpression inactivated the NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways by down-regulating extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and inhibitor of NF-B (IB) phosphorylation levels, as well as by inhibiting NF-kappa B translocation. Meanwhile, 14-3-3 gamma overexpression enhanced the expression levels of beta-casein, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), serine/threonine protein kinase Akt 1 (AKT1), sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR). These results suggest that 14-3-3 gamma was able to attenuate the LPS-induced inflammatory responses and promote proliferation and lactation in LPS-induced DCMECs by inhibiting the activation of the NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways and up-regulatingm TOR signaling pathways to protect against LPS-induced injury.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Fluoxetine Decreases the Proliferation and Adipogenic Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells", "Abstract": "Fluoxetine was originally developed as an antidepressant, but it has also been used to treat obesity. Although the anti-appetite effect of fluoxetine is well-documented, its potential effects on human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) or mature adipocytes have not been investigated. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of fluoxetine on the proliferation of ASCs. We also investigated its inhibitory effect on adipogenic differentiation. Fluoxetine significantly decreased ASC proliferation, and signal transduction PCR array analysis showed that it increased expression of autophagy-related genes. In addition, fluoxetine up-regulated SQSTM1 and LC3B protein expression as detected by western blotting and immunofluorescence. The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), significantly attenuated fluoxetine-mediated effects on ASC proliferation and SQSTM1/LC3B expression. In addition, 3-MA decreased the mRNA expression of two autophagy-related genes, beclin-1 and Atg7, in ASCs. Fluoxetine also significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and down-regulated the levels of PPAR-gamma and C/EBP-alpha in ASCs. Collectively, these results indicate that fluoxetine decreases ASC proliferation and adipogenic differentiation. This is the first in vitro evidence that fluoxetine can reduce fat accumulation by inhibiting ASC proliferation and differentiation.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Effects of Plant Growth Hormones on Mucor indicus Growth and Chitosan and Ethanol Production", "Abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and kinetin (KIN) on Mucor indicus growth, cell wall composition, and ethanol production. A semi-synthetic medium, supplemented with 0-5 mg/L hormones, was used for the cultivations (at 32 degrees C for 48 h). By addition of 1 mg/L of each hormone, the biomass and ethanol yields were increased and decreased, respectively. At higher levels, however, an inverse trend was observed. The glucosamine fraction of the cell wall, as a representative for chitosan, followed similar but sharper changes, compared to the biomass. The highest level was 221% higher than that obtained without hormones. The sum of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine (chitin and chitosan) was noticeably enhanced in the presence of the hormones. Increase of chitosan was accompanied by a decrease in the phosphate content, with the lowest phosphate (0.01 g/g cell wall) being obtained when the chitosan was at the maximum (0.45 g/g cell wall). In conclusion, IAA and KIN significantly enhanced the M. indicus growth and chitosan production, while at the same time decreasing the ethanol yield to some extent. This study shows that plant growth hormones have a high potential for the improvement of fungal chitosan production by M. indicus.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Centerband-only analysis of rotor-unsynchronized spin echo for measurement of lipid P-31 chemical shift anisotropy", "Abstract": "Structural diversity and molecular flexibility of phospholipids are essential for biological membranes to play key roles in numerous cellular processes. Uncovering the behavior of individual lipids in membrane dynamics is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying biological functions of cell membranes. In this paper, we introduce a simple method to investigate dynamics of lipid molecules in multi-component systems by measuring the P-31 chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) under magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions. For achieving both signal separation and CSA determination, we utilized a centerband-only analysis of rotor-unsynchronized spin echo (COARSE). This analysis is based on the curve fitting of periodic modulation of centerband intensity along the interpulse delay time in rotor-unsynchronized spin-echo experiments. The utility of COARSE was examined by using phospholipid vesicles, a three-component lipid raft model system, and archaeal purple membranes. We found that the apparent advantages of this method are high resolution and high sensitivity given by the moderate MAS speed and the one-dimensional acquisition with short spin-echo delays. COARSE provides an alternative method for CSA measurement that is effective in the investigation of lipid polymorphologies.

Here, we study the effect of particle size ratio on the thermal conductivity of granular mixtures containing rubber tire particles. Glass beads were mixed at various volume fractions with rubber particles of varying size. The 3D network model analysis using synthetic packed assemblies was used to determine the dominant factors influencing the thermal conduction of the mixtures. Results present that mixtures with varying size ratios exhibit different nonlinear evolutions of thermal conductivity values with mixture fractions. In particular, mixtures with large insulating materials (e.g., rubber particles) have higher thermal conduction that those with small ones. This is because the larger insulating particles allow better interconnectivity among the conductive particles, thereby avoiding the interruption of the thermal conduction of the conductive particles. Similar tests conducted with natural sand corroborate the significant effect of the relative size of the insulating particles. The 3D network model identifies the heterogeneity of local and effective thermal conductivity and the influence of connectivity among conductive particles.

During this series of experiments, the Firebrand Generator was fed with wood cubes of uniform size. The glowing firebrands generated were collected in an array of water-filled pans that were arranged to collect the bulk of the lofted firebrands. The pan arrangement was determined from repeated preliminary studies. These experiments were performed over a range of wind speeds (up to 9 m/s) to determine the lofting distance. The major change in these experiments from prior work was that, for a given wind speed, the firebrand size and mass was determined at each pan location. In the past, it was only possible to determine the number distribution; specifically the number of firebrands at each spatial location was counted (not resolved at every pan but only across a given row of pans). Statistical analysis indicated that a normal distribution was able to capture the number/mass percentage versus horizontal distance.

This study was aimed at distinguishing fire sources through a smoke analysis. For this purpose, a smoke detection chamber was created, which was equipped with one light source and several light sensors for enabling simultaneous detection of light extinction and scattering, respectively. The test fires considered in this study had two kinds of sources: single fire source (paper, wood, and flammable liquid) and mixed fire source (paper-wood, paper-flammable liquid, and wood-flammable liquid mixtures). The amounts of extinction and scattering for each fire were measured experimentally, and the discrete probability distributions were calculated from the measured scattering amount. The optical characteristics of each fire were obtained using extinction data and the calculated probability distributions. These optical characteristics were then used for learning of neural networks, and the learned neural networks were used to distinguish fire sources from smoke generated in the case of both single fires and mixed fires. Results revealed that the neural networks could precisely distinguish fire sources on the basis of the smoke particles in the case of both single fires and mixed fires. The results of this study are expected to be useful in developing an advanced smoke detector that can distinguish fire sources in addition to detecting smoke.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Determination of Cellulose Crystallinity of Banana Residues Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Multivariate Analysis", "Abstract": "Crystallinity is an important property of lignocellulosic biomass due to its significant effect on acid/enzymatic hydrolysis.

Thus, we intend to show the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and chemometrics to replace reference methods in crystallinity determination. The results show that NIRS can be used to determine crystallinity in banana residues by the use of partial least squares regression, providing good coefficients of determination (R-cal, pred(2) > 0.82), low relative errors (< 14%) and good range error ratio (>= 7.7).

In principle, solar energy can meet the worlds energy needs, but the intermittent nature of solar illumination means that it is temporally and spatially separated from its consumption. Developing systems that promote solar-to-fuel conversion, such as via reduction of protons to hydrogen, could bridge this production-consumption gap, but this effort requires invention of catalysts that are cheap, robust, and efficient and that use earth-abundant elements. In this context, catalysts that utilize water as both an earth-abundant, environmentally benign substrate and a solvent for proton reduction are highly desirable. This Account summarizes our studies of molecular metal-polypyridyl catalysts for electrochemical and photochemical reduction of protons to hydrogen. Inspired by concept transfer from biological and materials catalysts, these scaffolds are remarkably resistant to decomposition in water, with fast and selective electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversions that are sustainable for several days. Their modular nature offers a broad range of opportunities for tuning reactivity by molecular design, including altering ancillary ligand electronics, denticity, and/or incorporating redox-active elements. Our first-generation complex, [(PY4)Co(CH3CN)(2)](2+), catalyzes the reduction of protons from a strong organic acid to hydrogen in 50% water. Subsequent investigations with the pentapyridyl ligand PY5Me(2) furnished molybdenum and cobalt complexes capable of catalyzing the reduction of water in fully aqueous electrolyte with 100% Faradaic efficiency. Of particular note, the complex [(PY5Me(2))MoO](2+) possesses extremely high activity and durability in neutral water, with turnover frequencies at least 8500 mol of H-2 per mole of catalyst per hour and turnover numbers over 600 000 mol of H-2 per mole of catalyst over 3 days at an overpotential of 1.0 V, without apparent loss in activity. Replacing the oxo moiety with a disulfide affords [(PY5Me(2))MoS2](2+), which bears a molecular MoS2 triangle that structurally and functionally mimics bulk molybdenum disulfide, improving the catalytic activity for water reduction. In water buffered to pH 3, catalysis by [(PY5Me(2))MoS2](2+) onsets at 400 mV of overpotential, whereas [(PY5Me(2))MoO](2+) requires an additional 300 mV of driving force to operate at the same current density. Metalation of the PY5Me(2) ligand with an appropriate Co(ii) source also furnishes electrocatalysts that are active in water. Importantly, the onset of catalysis by the [(PY5Me(2))Co(H2O)](2+) series is anodically shifted by introducing electron-withdrawing functional groups on the ligand. With the [(bpy2PYMe)Co(CF3SO3)](1+) system, we showed that introducing a redox-active moiety can facilitate the electro- and photochemical reduction of protons from weak acids such as acetic acid or water. Using a high-throughput photochemical reactor, we examined the structure-reactivity relationship of a series of cobalt(ii) complexes.

SiO2@Bi2O3 composite fibers were fabricated via a process that entails hydrothermal growth of a bismuth precursor nanocoating (Bi-PN) on the surface of SiO2 fibers followed by the thermal treatment of the harvested SiO2@Bi-PN fibers.

A series of Er doped PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT:Er3+) nanofibers with tunable upconversion photoluminescence (PL) properties were successfully synthesized via a sol-gel based electrospinning process. By controlled crystallization, PZT:Er3+ nanofibers evolve from a polycrystalline to a single-crystalline-like structure, resulting in a remarkable increase in the visible upconversion emission intensity. It was uncovered that Er3+ doping site in PZT shifts from B site to A site with increase in crystallinity and crystal size. In addition, remarkable enhancement in red emission is observed with increased Er3+ doping concentration, which facilitates the modulation of emission colour from green to orange. Combined with the excellent ferroelectric properties of PZT, such spectral tunable PZT:Er3+ nanofibers are considered as a promising multifunctional candidate for integrated electro-mechano-optical devices.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Using a patterned grating structure to create lipid bilayer platforms insensitive to air bubbles", "Abstract": "Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) have been used for various biosensing applications. The bilayer structure enables embedded lipid membrane species to maintain their native orientation, and the two-dimensional fluidity is crucial for numerous biomolecular interactions to occur. The platform integrated with a microfluidic device for reagent transport and exchange has great potential to be applied with surface analytical tools. However, SLBs can easily be destroyed by air bubbles during assay reagent transport and exchange. Here, we created a patterned obstacle grating structured surface in a microfluidic channel to protect SLBs from being destroyed by air bubbles. Unlike all of the previous approaches using chemical modification or adding protection layers to strengthen lipid bilayers, the uniqueness of this approach is that it uses the patterned obstacles to physically trap water above the bilayers to prevent the air-water interface from directly coming into contact with and peeling the bilayers. We showed that our platform with certain grating geometry criteria can provide promising protection to SLBs from air bubbles. The required obstacle distance was found to decrease when we increased the air-bubble movement speed. In addition, the interaction assay results from streptavidin and biotinylated lipids in the confined SLBs suggested that receptors at the SLBs retained the interaction ability after air-bubble treatment. The results showed that the developed SLB platform can preserve both high membrane fluidity and high accessibility to the outside environment, which have never been simultaneously achieved before.

The loading control, molecular weight markers, and antigen/antibody titration are designed and integrated into the microfluidic chip, thus allowing for the quantification of proteins and nucleic acids. Importantly, we could easily distinguish the adjacent blotting bands inside parallel microchannels, which may be difficult to achieve in conventional blotting.

In this paper, an efficient microplatform based on reverse electrodialysis, which enables high ionic flux through three dimensional nanochannel networks for high power energy generation, is demonstrated. Highly effective cation-selective nanochannel networks are realized between two microfluidic channels with geometrically controlled in situ self-assembled nanoparticles in a cost-effective and simple way. The nano-interstices between the assembled nanoparticles have a role as collective three-dimensional nanochannel networks and they allow higher ionic flux under concentration gradients without decreasing diffusion potential, compared to standard one-dimensional nanochannels. An in-depth experimental study with theoretical analysis shows that the electrical power of the presented system can be flexibly tuned or further optimized by changing the size, material, and shape of the assembled nanoparticles or by the geometric control of the microchannel.

This D2D platform combines the strengths of the two formats-droplets-in-channel for facile generation of droplets containing single cells, and DMF for on-demand manipulation of droplets including control of different droplet volumes (pL-mu L), creation of a dilution series of ionic liquid (IL), and parallel single cell culturing and analysis for IL toxicity screening. This D2D device also allows for automated analysis that includes a feedback-controlled system for merging and splitting of droplets to add reagents, an integrated Peltier element for parallel cell culture at optimum temperature, and an impedance sensing mechanism to control the flow rate for droplet generation and preventing droplet evaporation. Droplet-in-channel is well-suited for encapsulation of single cells as it allows the careful manipulation of flow rates of aqueous phase containing cells and oil to optimize encapsulation. Once single cell containing droplets are generated, they are transferred to a DMF chip via a capillary where they are merged with droplets containing IL and cultured at 30 degrees C. The DMF chip, in addition to permitting cell culture and reagent (ionic liquid/salt) addition, also allows recovery of individual droplets for off-chip analysis such as further culturing and measurement of ethanol production. The D2D chip was used to evaluate the effect of IL/salt type (four types: NaOAc, NaCl, [C(2)mim] [OAc], [C(2)mim] [Cl]) and concentration (four concentrations: 0, 37.5, 75, 150 mM) on the growth kinetics and ethanol production of yeast and as expected, increasing IL concentration led to lower biomass and ethanol production. Specifically, [C(2)mim] [OAc] had inhibitory effects on yeast growth at concentrations 75 and 150 mM and significantly reduced their ethanol production compared to cells grown in other ILs/salts. The growth curve trends obtained by D2D matched conventional yeast culturing in microtiter wells, validating the D2D platform.

Although the heavy alkaline-earth hydrides are of limited interest for their hydrogen storage potential, owing to low gravimetric densities, their ionic nature may prove useful in new electrochemical applications, especially as an ionically conducting electrolyte material. Here we show that barium hydride shows fast pure ionic transport of hydride ions (H-) in the high-temperature, high-symmetry phase. Although some conductivity studies have been reported on related materials previously, the nature of the charge carriers has not been determined. BaH2 gives rise to hydride ion conductivity of 0.2 S cm(-1) at 630 degrees C. This is an order of magnitude larger than that of state-of-the-art proton-conducting perovskites or oxide ion conductors at this temperature.

Here, we employ a dye-sensitized semiconductor system combined with semiconductor-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to detect metal ions, using an approach based on the \"turn-off\" SERS strategy that takes advantage of the intrinsic capacity of the semiconductor to catalyze the degradation of a Raman probe. Alizarin red S (ARS)-sensitized colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were selected as an example to show how semiconductor-enhanced Raman spectroscopy enables the determination of Cr(VI) in water. Firstly, we explored the SERS mechanism of ARS-TiO2 complexes and found that the strong electronic coupling between ARS and colloidal TiO2 NPs gives rise to the formation of a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition, providing a new electronic transition pathway for the Raman process. Secondly, colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles were used as active sites to induce the self-degradation of the Raman probe adsorbed on their surfaces in the presence of Cr(VI). Our data demonstrate the potential of ARS-TiO2 complexes as a SERS-active sensing platform for Cr(VI) in an aqueous solution. Remarkably, the method proposed in this contribution is relatively simple, without requiring complex pretreatment and complicated instruments, but provides high sensitivity and excellent selectivity in a high-throughput fashion. Finally, the ARS-TiO2 complexes are successfully applied to the detection of Cr(VI) in environmental samples.

The gain in this function has been ascribed to specific CL/Cyt-c interactions. Here we report that the cationic protein Cyt-c is also able to interact electrostatically with the main lipid components of the mitochondrial membranes, the zwitterionic lipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), through the mediation of phosphate anions that bind specifically to amino groups in the surfaces of protein and model membranes. In these complexes, Cyt-c reacts efficiently with H2O2 at submillimolar levels, which oxidizes the sulfur atom of the axial ligand Met80. The modified protein is stable and presents significantly enhanced peroxidatic activity. Based on these results, we postulate that the rise of H2O2 concentrations to the submillimolar levels registered during initiation of the apoptotic program may represent one signaling event that triggers the gain in peroxidatic function of the Cyt-c molecules bound to the abundant PE and PC membrane components.

In this technique a static and uniform electric field is applied to sliced tissue sections during matrix spray-coating, resulting in the enrichment of positively or negatively chargeable analytes in the MALDI matrix layer. Experimental results show that MCAEF not only increased the sensitivity of lipid and protein detection across the board in the subsequent MALDI-MS analyses, but also resulted in successful imaging of a larger number of analytes. MALDI imaging enhancement with MCAEF was observed for various tissues (rat liver, rat brain, and porcine adrenal gland) and with different MALDI matrices (e.g., quercetin, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, dithranol, 9-aminoacridine, and sinapinic acid) and the sensitivity increases were independent of the solvent compositions and pH values of the matrix solutions. Taking rat brain as an example, MCAEF led to the on-tissue detection and imaging of 648 identified lipids by combining positive and negative ion detection by MALDI-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS and with quercetin as the matrix, as compared to only 344 lipids without MCAEF. For protein imaging, up to 232 protein signals were successfully detected in rat brain tissue sections by MALDI-time-of-flight MS within a mass range of 3500 to 37 000 Da, as compared to 119 without MCAEF.

A high specific capacitance of 204 F g(-1), areal capacitance of 1.15 F cm(-2), and volumetric capacitance of 63 F cm(-3) in 1 M H2SO4 are obtained, which are attributed to the surface functional groups participating in the pseudocapacitive redox reactions.

XPS results demonstrate that, different from other reported carbons, the carbon nanosheets largely contain pyrrolic and pyridinic groups, both of which are very suitable for Li storage. When the carbon nanosheets are used as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), they exhibit a high initial coulombic efficiency of ca. 63.1%, and a high and constant reversible capacity of 605 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) even after 100 cycles.

In contrast, commercial graphite has a value less than 20 mA h g(-1) at 3000 mA g(-1), showing one-tenth the capacity of the carbon nanosheet material. Such superior electrochemical performance is due to its high porosity, high nitrogen content of ca. 30 wt% and a unique two-dimensional (2D) structure.

Results on isolated LinSn4 clusters, with n = 0-10, revealed that the tetrahedron shaped Li4Sn4 Zintl cluster is the most stable owing to it having high symmetry as well as a largest highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap. This LinSn4 cluster weakly interacted with CNT as well as graphene for n <= 4, whereas a strong cation-pi interaction is observed between them for n > 4 which significantly reduces the Li clustering. The interaction between the Sn cluster and CNT or graphene is mediated only through Li ions whose absence destabilizes the Sn-C composite. These results were further confirmed by electronic density of states and band structure calculations.

The solution behaviour of CA-SL with different mass ratios of CTAB/SL-PEG was studied.

We used MD simulations to develop a scattering density profile (SDP) model, which was then utilized to jointly refine SANS and SAXS data. In addition to commonly reported lipid bilayer structural parameters, component distributions were obtained, including the volume probability, electron density and neutron scattering length density. Of note, the distance between electron density maxima D-HH (39.4 angstrom) and the hydrocarbon chain thickness 2D(C) (29.1 angstrom) of TOCL bilayers were both found to be larger than the corresponding values for dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. Conversely, TOCL bilayers have a smaller overall bilayer thickness D-B (36.7 angstrom), primarily due to their smaller headgroup volume per phosphate. SDP analysis yielded a lipid area of 129.8 angstrom(2), indicating that the cross-sectional area per oleoyl chain in TOCL bilayers (i.e., 32.5 angstrom(2)) is smaller than that for DOPC bilayers. Multiple sets of MD simulations were performed with the lipid area constrained at different values. The calculated surface tension versus lipid area resulted in a lateral area compressibility modulus K-A of 342 mN m(-1), which is slightly larger compared to DOPC bilayers. Model free comparison to experimental scattering data revealed the best simulated TOCL bilayer from which detailed molecular interactions were determined. Specifically, Na+ cations were found to interact most strongly with the glycerol hydroxyl linkage, followed by the phosphate and backbone carbonyl oxygens. Inter-and intra-lipid interactions were facilitated by hydrogen bonding between the glycerol hydroxyl and phosphate oxygen, but not with the backbone carbonyl. Finally, analysis of the intermediate scattering functions from NSE spectroscopy measurements of TOCL bilayers yielded a bending modulus K-C of 1.06 x 10(-19) J, which was larger than that observed in DOPC bilayers.

Further information on the interaction of neutral fluorenes within the phospholipid bilayer was obtained by an infrared (IR) spectroscopic study of films of DMPC and of the phospholipid with PFO deuterated specifically on its alkyl chains (DMPC-PFO-d(34)). This was complemented by measurements of the effect of F, TF and two neutral polymers: polyfluorene poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl), PFO, and poly(9,9-di-n-dodecylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl), PFD, on the phospholipid phase transition temperature using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Changes in liposome size upon addition of F and PFO were followed by dynamic light scattering. In addition, the spectroscopic properties of F, TF, PFO and PFD solubilised in DMPC liposomes (absorption, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence) were compared with those of the same probes in typical organic solvents (chloroform, cyclohexane and ethanol). Combining the insight from MD simulations with the results at the molecular level from the various experimental techniques suggests that while the small molecules have a tendency to be located in the phospholipid head group region, the polymers are incorporated within the lipid bilayers, with the backbone predominantly orthogonal to the phospholipid alkyl chains and with interdigitation of them and the PFO alkyl chains.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Degradation properties and metabolic activity of alginate and chitosan polyelectrolytes for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications", "Abstract": "Polysaccharides are long monosaccharide units which are emerging as promising materials for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications due to their biocompatibility, mostly good availability and tailorable properties, by to the wide possibility to modify chemical composition, structure-i.e., linear chain or branching-and polymer source (animals, plants, microorganisms).

The key criteria for separating melting products to different phases are the difference in density, viscosity and surface tension of the melted slag. The separation of the molten slag to the phases and the reduction of the settling time of the melt in the furnace will be promoted by the increasing the density and surface tension of the lead and matte-molten slag, and reduction in viscosity of the latter. The processing of lead-copper-zinc containing sulfide raw material was carried by the reduction smelting method and the purging of melt with a natural gas at a rectangular electric furnace. Dust collection system was connected to the furnace through the duct work. The feedstock loading was carried out through the furnace crown.

Generally, polyester films obtained are hydrophobic, insoluble in common solvents, amorphous and infusible as revealed by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry.

At current density of 200 mA g(-1), WS2-3Dgn nanocomposites can retain a capacity of 748 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles with Coulombic Efficiency (CE) higher than 98%, indicating outstanding cycling stability. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between the WS2 nanoflakes and the highly conductive 3Dgn network as well as their rationally designed nano-architecture. These results demonstrate a feasible and simple method to synthesize WS2 based hybrid nanocomposites on 3Dgn for next generation high performance LIBs electrode materials.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Polyaniline nanowhiskers induced low methanol permeability and high membrane selectivity in partially sulfonated PVdF-co-HFP membranes", "Abstract": "Sulfonated poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoro propylene) (SPVdF-co-HFP) and polyaniline (PAni) have shown promise as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) materials, especially in direct methanol fuel cells, by virtue of their significantly high ion-exchange capacity (IEC) and membrane selectivity ratio. It was intuited that utilization of PAni nanostructures, with high surface areas, in PEMs can result in further improvement of these attributes. With this objective, positively-charged PAni nanofibers (NFs) were synthesized. Interestingly, when these NFs were exposed to a negatively-charged amphiphile solution for different time extents and followed by washing with an organic solvent, PAni nanowhiskers (NWs) having lengths between 40-120 nm and diameters between 10-40 nm were formed. BET surface area exhibited an increase upon decrease in the aspect ratio of the NFs. Membranes were fabricated using SPVdF-co-HFP as the continuous phase and PAni granules, NFs or NWs as the dispersed phase. SPVdF-co-HFP/PAni NWs and SPVdF-co-HFP/PAni NFs membranes exhibited enhanced IECs, proton conductivities and selectivities compared to SPVdF-co-HFP/PAni granules membrane. However, comparisons between SPVdF-co-HFP/PAni NFs and SPVdF-co-HFP/PAni NWs membranes revealed that the extended conjugation available for the former versus the higher surface area of the latter played a crucial role in determining the uptake and transport properties of the membranes.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Chemotaxonomic discrimination of lichen species using an infrared chalcogenide fibre optic sensor: a useful tool for on-field biosourcing", "Abstract": "Many analytical methods are known to discriminate natural products based on the set of chemical compounds they contain.

Ten species of lichens including four chlorolichens (three Cladonia species and Stereocaulon scutelligerum), three tripartite lichens (Stereocaulon species) and three cyanolichens (Lichina pygmaea, Collema cristatum, Peltigera membranacea) belonging to six genera and six families were studied. One macroscopic cyanobacterium (Nostoc sp.), corresponding to the photobiont partner of Peltigera and Collema cyanolichens, was included for comparison. MIR spectra were acquired from lichen organic extracts between 3800-950 cm(-1) using a chalcogenide infrared fibre optical device. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and PCA-LDA (PCA-Linear Discriminant Analysis) based on the concept of variable clustering has been applied to absorbance MIR second derivative spectra for classification of the 11 species. The method succeeded in separating all lichen species and in identifying the major compounds. Moreover, the signature of the sample was specific of each lichen suggesting that minor compounds played a role. Our data showed that FEWS optical sensor profiling is a rapid, efficient and convenient tool for metabolic profiling and suggest that it can be used: (i) in chemotaxonomic approaches, (ii) in processes for certification requirements in active compounds availability, and (iii) in identifying new biosourcings in so far non-investigated lichen species.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Biodegradable poly(butylene succinate-co-terephthalate) nanofibrous membranes functionalized with cyclodextrin polymer for effective methylene blue adsorption", "Abstract": "The burgeoning electrospinning technology brings about a diversity of nanofibers and promotes their applications in various fields including wastewater treatment.

Furthermore, there was much higher efficiency in removing methylene blue (MB) dye on the resultant PBST/CDP nanofibrous membranes than that on pure CDP, or PBST nanofibrous membrane. The adsorption performance of the composite membranes to MB molecules was influenced greatly by the amount of CDP that dominated the surface area and surface morphologies of the prepared membranes. The adsorption kinetics of PBST/CDP nanofibrous membrane fitted well with the pseudo-second order model and Langmuir isotherm model well described the relationship between the adsorption capacity and initial MB solution concentration, exhibiting the maximum adsorption capacity of 90.9 mg g(-1), which was much higher than the adsorption capacity of the other adsorbents.

The adsorption mechanism of polysorbate 80 on nanoparticles is not known due to a lack of suitable techniques for quantification at low concentrations. Here we report the probable mechanism of polysorbate 80 adsorption on poly-D, L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles using a novel extraction procedure coupled with a highly sensitive attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopic method. Both methods facilitated the characterization and quantification of extracted surfactant at the nanogram level. Adsorption isotherm modeling reveals that polysorbate 80 follows a physisorption process (Delta G = 38 kJ Mol(-1)) and forms a monolayer on the nanoparticle surface. Thermal analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further support polysorbate 80 coating and surface coverage on PLGA nanoparticles. Real-time ATR-FTIR analysis shows that polysorbate 80 interacts with nanoparticles through the ester group (-C=O) and acyl chain (-CH2) during the adsorption. The extent and direction of band shifts in real-time FTIR experiments suggest that the acyl chain of polysorbate 80 micelles loses its ordered structure and becomes flexible with a higher gauche/trans conformer ratio. Reduction in the degree of hydration of the ester group indicates an increase in hydrophobic interactions in the presence of PLGA nanoparticles. The results of FTIR analysis states that polysorbate 80 acquires a flat structure on the nanoparticle surface. This study on polysorbate 80 quantification and adsorption with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy can be extended to other non-ionic surfactants which will ultimately help in determination of biological fate of surfactant coated nanoparticles under in vivo conditions.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Design of graphene oxide/gelatin electrospun nanocomposite fibers for tissue engineering applications", "Abstract": "Gelatin is a biodegradable, nontoxic and biocompatible biopolymer.

SiO2 nanoparticle (nano-SiO2) incorporation was initially found to produce rougher surfaces, lower the specific capacitance and postpone the transport of protons, which deteriorated the performance of the transistors. The advantage of nano-SiO2 incorporation lies in their ability to significantly improve the transistor's negative bias stability due to a proposed proton blocking mechanism. By applying doping of H3PO4, the negative effects of nano-SiO2 incorporation were partially counterbalanced. This is because H3PO4 can donate more protons and assist the proton conduction via the donor/acceptor process of amphoteric acids or forming the molecular network of hydrogen bonds.

The unique 3D network structures of the aerogels enable a remarkable reduction in their thermal conductivities. It is shown that the CNT-Ag nanocomposite aerogels (CNTANAs) possess low thermal conductivities of only 0.06 to 0.095 W m(-1) k(-1) with various Ag contents at room temperature; these values are much lower than those of other reported CNT and Ag composites with non-porous structures. Moreover, the electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients of the CNTANAs can be simultaneously enhanced by increasing the Ag content in the unique structure; this overcomes a drawback of bulk semiconductors wherein increasing electrical conductivity is generally accompanied by a reduced Seebeck coefficient and enhances the thermal conductivity. As a result, this strategy results in a maximum ZT value of 0.011. This ZT value is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the carbon aerogel and 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the silver/polymer composites and CNT/polymer composites.

The synergistic effect made ZTV a unique ethanol sensor (98.96%) with a fast adsorption and desorption rate of 32 s and 6 s, respectively. The morphological contribution from the zinc-tin oxide nanocomposite (ZT) and zinc-vanadium oxide nanocomposite (ZV) in the ZTV system provides a larger surface area which in turn promotes a higher number of surface active sites for the adsorption of ethanol molecules on the surface. The catalytic activity along with different reductive-oxidative states had a larger impact on the enhanced ethanol sensing ability of the ZTV system even at room temperature. In this present work, the novel material, ZTV which exhibits excellent ethanol sensing characteristics at room temperature is investigated and the mechanism behind the sensing behaviour of ZTV is elucidated based on its structure and morphology.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "The lysis and regrowth of toxic cyanobacteria during storage of achitosan-aluminium chloride composite coagulated sludge: implications for drinking water sludge treatment", "Abstract": "Coagulation is a key unit operation for cyanobacterial cell removal; however, the potential danger of cyanobacterial cells transferred into sludge is not well understood. In this study, the fate of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) and secondary metabolites in chitosan-aluminium chloride (CTSAC) coagulated cyanobacteria-laden sludge were investigated during the sludge storage period. The extracellular microcystins (MCs) can be adsorbed onto the CTSAC flocs for six days with a reduced biodegradation rate. Less M. aeruginosa cell lysis was observed in the coagulated system than in the natural cell system, due to the protection of M. aeruginosa by the CTSAC. Furthermore, the residual Al content decreased in the cyanobacteria-laden sludge supernatant. The amount of extracellular organic matter (EOM) stayed low in the coagulated system for four days. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis showed that coexisting bacteria reduced in the sludge during the initial four days storage time. Interestingly, the CTSAC degradation favored the growth of the M. aeruginosa cells. This study will be helpful for better understanding and managing secondary metabolite pollution problems related to coagulation-generated cyanobacteria-laden sludge during the sludge supernatant recycling process.

The conductive hydrogel electrode membrane was prepared through a combined approach involving electrophoretic deposition treatment and in situ synthesis. The fabricated membrane had a laminated structure with three-dimensional nanopores, with a structure resembling a RANEY (R)-type platinum, albeit the conductive hydrogel electrode membrane had the higher oxygen tolerance than the RANEY (R)-type platinum. We utilized the conductive hydrogel electrode membrane as the anode and a platinum sheet as the cathode to build a single compartment implantable glucose fuel cell. Even in the case of the platinum sheet cathode, having very limited catalytic activity, the performance of the fuel cell was close to the implantable RANEY (R)-type platinum fuel cell.

Recently, we developed mineral-binding gelatine nanoparticles with enhanced affinity to calcium phosphate by conjugating alendronate (ALN) molecules onto their surface. Herein, we have enhanced the functionality of these nanoparticles by rendering them potentially therapeutically active via covalent linking of an anticancer platinum-bisphosphonate (Pt-BP) complex. Different functionalisation schemes and molar ratios between reactants were screened and the effective functionalisation of gelatine nanoparticles with Pt-BP (or with both Pt-BP and ALN) was assessed. Our results revealed that the degree of functionalisation could be tailored by varying the molar ratio of Pt-BP and ALN relative to glutaraldehyde used as crosslinker. A sustained and tunable release of platinum as a function of the initial Pt-BP/ALN/ glutaraldehyde molar ratio was achieved for both Pt-BP-and dual-functionalised gelatine nanoparticles. Moreover, dual-functionalised gelatine nanoparticles also displayed a high affinity to hydroxyapatitecoated surfaces thanks to the presence of ALN.

Experimental evaluation as well as a simulation of the cis-rich pinane extraction capacity have been undertaken. The predictive approach was performed using the simulation software COSMO-RS (conductor like screening model for realistic solvents), which uses a statistical thermodynamics approach based on the result of quantum chemical calculation, for the understanding of dissolving mechanism. COSMO-RS simulation showed that the bio-based solvent is a good solvent to solubilize carotenoids, oil from rapeseed and aromas from caraway seeds. The experimental results indicated that the highest carotenoid yield was obtained with the cis-rich pinane with 95.4% of the maximum carotenoid content in carrots while n-hexane was only able to extract 78.1% of them. With respect to the extraction of oil from rapeseeds, both solvents showed similar extraction yields and no differences were observed in the fatty acid profiles. In relation to the aromas, the characterization of the essential oil extracted by the two solvents showed a similar composition, where carvone (64%) was the main component followed by limonene (34%).

Frequency and voltage dependence of epsilon', epsilon', tan delta, electric modulus (M' and M '') and sigma(ac) of PrBaCoO nanofiber capacitor have been investigated by using impedance spectroscopy method. The obtained experimental results show that the values of epsilon', epsilon', tand, M', M '' and sigma(ac) of the PrBaCoO nanofiber capacitor are strongly dependent on frequency of applied bias voltage. The values of epsilon', epsilon '' and tand show a steep decrease with increasing frequency for each forward bias voltage, whereas the values of sigma(ac) and the electric modulus increase with increasing frequency. The high dispersion in epsilon' and epsilon '' values at low frequencies may be attributed to the Maxwell-Wagner and space charge polarization. The high values of epsilon' may be due to the interfacial effects within the material, PrBaCoO nanofibers interfacial layer and electron effect. The values of M ' and M '' reach a maximum constant value corresponding to M-infinity approximate to 1/epsilon(infinity) due to the relaxation process at high frequencies, but both the values of M ' and M '' approach almost to zero at low frequencies. The changes in the dielectric and electrical properties with frequency can be also attributed to the existence of N-ss and R-s of the capacitors. As a result, the change in the epsilon', epsilon '', tan delta, M', M '' and ac electric conductivity (sigma(ac)) is a result of restructuring and reordering of charges at the PrBaCoO/n-Si interface under an external electric field or voltage and interface polarization.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicated that the thermal stability and char yields of the nanocomposites were enhanced compared to the neat poly(ether-imide). Microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) revealed that the synthesized poly(ether-imide) had low flammability. The incorporation of functional Fe3O4 nanoparticles could further improve the combustion properties of poly(ether-imide). The high interaction between poly(ether-imide) and functional Fe3O4, the presence of an imide group and high hydroxyl content of the functional Fe3O4 nanoparticles seem to be responsible for the improvement of the thermal and combustion properties. Furthermore, the presence of methyl, ether and bulky xanthene groups in the polyimide backbone decreased the glass transition temperature (T-g) and increased the solubility in organic solvents. These properties will be useful for processing and new applications of poly(ether-imide).", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Nickel oxide aerogel for high performance supercapacitor electrodes", "Abstract": "Monolithic NiO aerogels were prepared by a facile citric acid assisted sol-gel method for supercapacitor electrodes.

We report that, not only does increasing the surface charge density lead to greater structural ordering and a stiffening of the membrane, which is consistent with classical theory of charge effects on membranes, but also that the relaxation rate of the membrane thickness fluctuations decreases without affecting the fluctuation amplitude. From the relaxation rate we demonstrate, using recent theory, that the viscosity of the surfactant membrane is increased with surface charge density, which suggests that the amount of charge controls the diffusion behavior of inclusions inside the membrane. The present results confirm that the thickness fluctuation relaxation rate and amplitude are tuned independently since the membrane viscosity is only influencing the relaxation rate. This work demonstrates that charge stabilization of lamellar bilayers is not merely affected by intermembrane interactions and structural ordering but that intramembrane dynamics also have a significant contribution.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Background dielectric permittivity: Material constant or fitting parameter?", "Abstract": "The concept of background dielectric constant proposed by Tagantsev, together with the distinction between critical and non-critical electric polarizations as a natural extension for the order parameter of ferroelectric phase transitions, is critically discussed.

PEC water splitting has the potential to become a key technology in achieving a sustainable society, if high solar to fuel energy conversion efficiencies are obtained with earth abundant materials. This review article discusses recent developments and discoveries in the mechanisms by which the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in metallic nanoparticles can increase or complement a neighbouring semiconductor in light absorption for catalytic water splitting applications. These mechanisms can mitigate the intrinsic optical limitations of semiconductors (e.g., metal oxides) for efficient solar water splitting. We identify four types of enhancement mechanisms in the recent literature: (i) light scattering, (ii) light concentration, (iii) hot electron injection (HEI), and (iv) plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET). (i) Light scattering and (ii) light concentration are light trapping mechanisms that can increase the absorption of light with energies above the semiconductor optical band-edge. These two mechanisms are ideal to enhance the absorption of promising semiconductors with narrow bandgap energies that suffer from limited absorption coefficients and bulk charge recombination. On the other hand, (iii) HEI and the recently discovered (iv) PIRET are mechanisms that can enhance the absorption also below the semiconductor optical band-edge. Therefore, HEI and PIRET have the potential to extend the light utilization to visible and near-infrared wavelengths of semiconductors with excellent electrochemical properties, but with large bandgap energies. New techniques and theories that have been developed to elucidate the above mentioned plasmonic mechanisms are presented and discussed for their application in metal oxide photoelectrodes. Finally, other plasmonic and non-plasmonic effects that do not increase the device absorption, but affect the electrochemical properties of the semiconductor (e.g., charge carrier transport) are also discussed, since a complete understanding of these phenomena is fundamental for the design of an efficient plasmonic NP-semiconductor water splitting device.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Controllable preparation of an eggshell membrane supported hydrogel electrolyte with thickness-dependent electrochemical performance", "Abstract": "The preparation of thin gel electrolyte membranes with controllable thickness is important to explore the thickness-dependent electrochemical behaviors; this can further guide the fabrication of energy devices.

The reduced graphene oxide sheets form an integrated three-dimensional network to accommodate GNPs, while the GNPs act as reinforcements to avoid excessive volume shrinkage of the network during the air drying process. Octadecanol is thus easily impregnated into the porous graphene network to obtain octadecanol/graphene phase change composites (PCCs) with exceptional thermal conductivities.

Hydrazone linked cationic conjugates poly(ethyleneimine)-C6-succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone-DOX center dot HCl (PEI-C6-SANH-DOX center dot HCl, PEI-C-DOX) was synthesized, then condensed the DOX center dot HCl loaded 21-base (CGA) 7 oligodeoxynucleotides (CGA-ODNs/DOX center dot HCl, OD) to get the dual methods DOX center dot HCl loaded nanoparticles PEI-C-DOX/OD (POD) as inner core. Subsequently, O-carboxymethyl-chitosan (CMCS) was coated on POD to construct the core-shell nanoparticles CMCS/POD (CPOD). The average size and zeta potential of CPOD were (165.0 +/- 3.3) nm and -(15.6 +/- 0.82) mV, respectively. In vitro evaluation showed that CMCS could dissociate from POD at tumor extracellular pH values, and the cellular uptake of CPOD was much higher than that at pH 7.4 (p < 0.005 in B16 cells, p < 0.01 in HepG2 cells). Besides, in vitro release study revealed that the drug release amount from CPOD at endo/lysosome pH was significantly more than that at pH 7.4 (p < 0.005), which was further indicated by nuclear localization test. In vivo NIRF imaging illustrated the accumulation in tumor of CPOD for 24 h. Furthermore, in vivo anti-tumor test indicated that CPOD exhibited more superior anti-tumor efficacy even than double dosage DOX center dot HCl solution. No visible tissue lesions of main organs in CPOD group were observed, indicating preliminary in vivo safety of CPOD.

In this work, we used united-atom molecular dynamics simulations to understand the effects of three counterions (Na+, Ca2+ at pH 7 and Cl- at pH 2) and temperature change on the stability of the lauryl-VVAGERGD peptide amphiphile self-assembly. This molecule contains a bioactive RGD peptide sequence and has been shown to support cellular adhesion and proliferation in vitro. A 19-layered peptide nanostructure, containing 12 peptide amphiphile molecules per layer, was previously shown to exhibit optimal stability and it was used as the model nanofiber system. Peptide backbone stability was studied under increasing temperatures (300-358 K) using the number of hydrogen bonds and root-mean-square deviations of nanofiber size. At higher temperatures, fiber disintegration was observed to be dependent on the type of counter-ion used for nanofiber formation. Interestingly, rapid heating to higher temperatures could sometimes reestablish the integrity of the nanofiber backbone, possibly by allowing the system to bypass an energy barrier and assuming a more thermodynamically stable configuration. As counterion identity was observed to exhibit remarkable effects on the thermal stability of peptide nanofibers, we suggest that these behaviors should be considered while developing new materials for potential applications.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "An investigation on the aqueous-phase hydrodeoxygenation of various methoxy-substituted lignin monomers on Pd/C and HZSM-5 catalysts", "Abstract": "Aqueous phase catalytic upgrading of lignin monomers to hydrocarbons via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) has been explored using a combination of Pd/C and HZSM-5 catalysts under 2 MPa of H-2 (ambient temperature). Model monomers with varying numbers of methoxy groups, including phenol, anisole, guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxy-phenol, were chosen as lignin model compounds. Mechanistic studies revealed cascade and parallel reaction pathways via hydrogenation and dehydration (hydrolysis) processes, which were catalyzed by Pd/C and HZSM-5, respectively. Hydrogenation was preferred at lower temperature, whereas higher temperature was favorable for the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups. The effect of methoxy groups on the HDO of these monomers was also investigated systematically. Basically, the conversion of multi-substituted monomers was tougher than that of monosubstituted ones, due to steric constraint and the inhibition of the electron-donating hydroxyl group. The selectivities to cyclohexane from phenol and anisole were improved significantly by increasing the temperature to 413 K. However, cyclohexanone was preferably produced over cyclohexane when using model compounds with multi-substituents (guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxy-phenol), even at temperatures above 513 K. Comparative experiments were also conducted on the HDO of 1,2-cyclohexanediol with or without the presence of phenol, which clearly suggested that the further HDO of guaiacol and 2,6-dimethoxy-phenol was inhibited, probably due to the strong interactions between cyclohexanediol molecules and Bronsted acid sites.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Polyaniline-polystyrene membrane for simple and efficient retrieval of double-stranded DNA from aqueous media", "Abstract": "Extraction of nucleic acids from biological samples is a necessary step in almost all biotechnological procedures.

Consequently, the development of new systems or methods devoted to the improvement of DNA extraction protocols in terms of yield, purity, time, and cost continues to be of great interest. In this work, we describe the preparation of a novel type of polyaniline/polystyrene (PANI/PS) membrane that not only exhibits high levels of capture of DNA strands dissolved in aqueous solutions but also allows for their simple and efficient posterior release. The composite membrane consists of electrospun PS fibres that were modified by the incorporation of PANI nanograins obtained through an in situ chemical polymerization. We have used sodium salt of Salmon Sperm DNA aqueous solutions as a model system to examine how large would be the adsorption capacity of these membranes towards nucleic acid molecules. In batch-mode experiments, we have found a maximum adsorption capacity of 153.8 mg of DNA per gram of PANI, with the saturation limit attained within only 9 min. In addition, we have demonstrated that it is possible to achieve the complete release of the adsorbed DNA by simple changes on the pH of the aqueous medium.

Parameters affecting the uptake of Cr(VI) ions by Alg-CB-X such as solution pH, initial concentration, contact time and coexisting anions were investigated systematically in batch experiments. The mechanism investigation showed that the removal of Cr(VI) involved electrostatic attraction and slightly involved redox reactions. However, it is emphasized that the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was very slow and occurred only slightly because of the lack of oxygen-containing functional groups (caused by the pyrolysis process) and the short adsorption period. With increasing experiment time and initial concentration of Cr(VI), the amount of reduced Cr(III) increased gradually. Finally, Cr(VI) is deposited onto the carbon surface, and the formed Cr(III) is released into the aqueous phase due to electronic repulsion between the positively-charged groups and the Cr(III).", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Room-temperature volatile organic compounds sensing based on WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)O, hexagonal-WO3, and their reduced graphene oxide composites", "Abstract": "Nanostructured orthorhombic WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)O, hexagonal h-WO3 and their RGO composites (RGO-WO3 center dot 0.33H(2)Oand RGO-h-WO3) are reported for the purpose of efficient sensing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (e.g. acetone, methanol, benzene, toluene, and m-xylene).

It was found that the interfacial layers were comprised of two main regions, a dense top layer of 18-25 angstrom and a loose bottom layer of 25-30 angstrom. Half of the top dense layer was exposed to air with the remainder of the top layer and the diffuse bottom layer immersed in the aqueous solution. Both the volume fraction and the layer thickness increased with keratin solution concentration as did the adsorbed amount which was seen to plateau just above 2 mg m(-2) at approximately 0.1 g dm(-3) (2.1 mu M). Increase in [NaCl] led to reduced surface adsorption, accompanied with the thinning of the top layer. Cryo-TEM imaging revealed that the keratin aggregates had an ellipsoidal structure with radii ranging from 60 angstrom to 220 angstrom. The ellipsoidal shape was well supported by SANS, with the major radius of 140 angstrom and the minor radius of 60 angstrom. With increasing [NaCl], the ellipsoids became thinner but longer, a feature consistent with the observed trend from surface adsorbed layer. This unusual behaviour could be explained by the electrostatic screening effect.

The nanomaterials include commercially available magnetite (Fe3O4) and magnetite modified to incorporate manganese (Mn) into the crystal structure. The chemical stability of these nanomaterials was evaluated in Hanford Site, WA ground water between the natural pH (similar to 8) and pH 1. Whereas the magnetite was observed to have good stability over the pH range, the Mn-doped material was observed to leach Mn at low pH. The materials were evaluated in parallel to characterize their uptake performance of the alpha-emitting radionuclide spikes from ground water across a range of pH (from similar to 8 down to 2). In addition, radiotracer uptake experiments were performed on Columbia River water, seawater, and human urine at their natural pH and at pH 2. Despite the observed leaching of Mn from the Mn-doped nanomaterial in the lower pH range, it exhibited generally superior analyte extraction performance compared to the magnetite, and analyte uptake was observed across a broader pH range. We show that the uptake behavior of the various radiotracers on these two materials at different pH levels can generally be explained by the amphoteric nature of the nanoparticle surfaces. Finally, the rate of sorption of the radiotracers on the two materials in unacidified ground water was evaluated. The uptake curves generally indicate that equilibrium is obtained within a few minutes, which is attributed to the high surface areas of the nanomaterials and the high level of dispersion in the liquids.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for identifying innovative chemotypes capable of modulating unexploited drug targets. The transient receptor potential (TRPs) channels persist scarcely explored as targets, despite intervening in a plethora of pathophysiological events in numerous diseases, including cancer. Both agonists and antagonists have proven capable of evoking phenotype changes leading to either cell death or reduced cell migration. Among these, natural products entail biologically pre-validated and privileged architectures for TRP recognition. Furthermore, several natural products have significantly contributed to our current knowledge on TRP biology. In this Tutorial Review we focus on selected natural products, e.g. capsaicinoids, cannabinoids and terpenes, by highlighting challenges and opportunities in their use as starting points for designing natural productinspired TRP channel modulators. Importantly, the de-orphanization of natural products as TRP channel ligands may leverage their exploration as viable strategy for developing anticancer therapies.

The governing mechanism of the calcination-induced structural evolution, however, remains controversial. Herein, we present our interpretation of the structural transformation from solid electrospun fibers into wire-in-tubes (single- and double-layer tubes) in a TiO2-VxOy system. We believe that the structural evolution is the result of a delamination of the crystalline crust from the underneath amorphous layer due to the different degrees of volume contraction, where the lock-up of the crystalline crust and the fluidity of the remaining organics plays vital roles. By tuning the calcination parameters, including the atmosphere, temperature and heating rate, the structural features of the hollow product fibers can be modulated.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "A Gibeon meteorite yields a high-performance water oxidation electrocatalyst", "Abstract": "Examining the electrocatalytic performance of naturally-occurring metallic minerals is of interest for energy conversion applications given their unique atomic composition and formation history.

The solubilized lignin can be rapidly and quantitatively recovered with the addition of ethanol. The computational and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies confirm that strong hydrogen bond interactions between EG and the free hydroxyl groups present in lignin contribute to the lignin dissolution. In addition, hydrogen peroxide mediated depolymerization of the dissolved lignin at a low temperature (80 degrees C) was tested and the effect of EG molecules on depolymerization of lignin was also theoretically studied.

Strong alkalinity of the reaction medium is necessary in order to dissolve lignin and to obtain an electrically conducting solution. However, strong alkalinity is supposed to be one of the reasons for consecutive oxidations to undesired organic acids and carbon dioxide. The high pH also limits the use of only a few metals as electrode materials. We report the use of pure deep eutectic solvents (DES) in order to dissolve lignin in combination with electrochemical oxidative depolymerisation.

These biopharmaceuticals have become increasingly important, reinforcing the current demand for the development of more benign, scalable and cost-effective techniques for their purification. Typical polymer-polymer and polymer-salt aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) have been studied for such a goal; yet, the limited polarity range of the coexisting phases and their low selective nature still are their major drawbacks. To overcome this limitation, in this work, ABS formed by bio-based ionic liquids (ILs) and biocompatible polymers were investigated. Bio-based ILs composed of ions derived from natural sources, namely composed of the cholinium cation and anions derived from plants natural acids, have been designed, synthesized, characterized and used for the creation of ABS with polypropyleneglycol (PPG 400). The respective ternary phase diagrams were initially determined at 25 degrees C to infer on mixture compositions required to form aqueous systems of two phases, further applied in the extraction of pure immunoglobulin G (IgG) to identify the most promising bio-based ILs, and finally employed in the purification of IgG from complex and real matrices of rabbit serum. Remarkably, the complete extraction of IgG to the IL-rich phase was achieved in a single-step. With pure IgG a recovery yield of 100% was obtained, while with rabbit serum this value slightly decreased to ca. 85%. Nevertheless, a 58% enhancement in the IgG purity was achieved when compared with its purity in serum samples. The stability of IgG before and after extraction was also evaluated by size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).

It is usually attributed to both FeII catalyzed oxidation and acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cellulose, yet the dominant degradation pathway remains an open question. In this work, electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was used to identify radicals involved in cellulose degradation. Papers impregnated with iron salts were put in contact with an aqueous solution of DMPO (spin-trap) and analyzed by ESR. No DMPO-OH center dot adducts were detected while the addition of formate, an intermediary target molecule, led on the contrary to the detection of a significant amount of DMPO-CO2 center dot- adducts. This reveals the predominant occurrence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) other than hydroxyl radicals (most likely superoxide or hydroperoxyl radicals). The production of DMPO-CO2 center dot- adducts was found to be oxygen dependent and to originate mainly from ferrous ions lixiviated from the impregnated papers. At high iron loads (above 1 mmol L-1), it was shown that quantification of these adducts should be done with great care because of a competing formation of hydroxylamine that jeopardizes the ESR signal. Complementary TPA hydroxylation measurements performed by HPLC on ink and iron sulfate impregnated papers revealed some production of hydroxyl radicals but at a concentration several orders of magnitude below that of the ROS detected with formation of DMPO-CO2 center dot- adducts. This HO center dot production was moreover not correlated with cellulose chain scissions, indicating that autooxidation by these radicals is not the main mechanism of cellulose depolymerisation in presence of iron gall ink.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Is the conductive agent useful in electrodes of graphitized activated carbon?", "Abstract": "In the making process of supercapacitors, the conductive agent carbon black is used for improving the conductivity of the electrodes and decreasing the resistance of interaction.

The excellent performance of PA hydrogels is ascribed to dynamic ionic bond formation through inter-and intra-chain interactions. The randomness results in ionic bonds of wide strength distribution, the strong bonds, which serve as permanent crosslinking, imparting the elasticity, while the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. In this work, we developed a simple physical method, called a pre-stretching method, to promote the performance of PA hydrogels. By imposing a pre-stretching on the sample in the as-prepared state, ion complexation during dialysis is prominently accelerated and the final performance is largely promoted. Further analysis suggests that the strong bond formation induced by pre-stretching is responsible for the change in final performance.

It was demonstrated that the stabilities of the gel-emulsions and the resultant wet porous silica gels originate from the utilization of a specially designed stabilizer, which is a derivative of cholesterol (Chol-OH). With the aid of Chol-OH, the chemical functionalities and the densities of the monolithic silica aerogels could be largely tuned via simple variation of the structures of the precursors, organosilanes, and water content in the gel emulsions.

Thus, the development of more efficient fluoride scavenging materials for designing water filters is an immediate task for researchers. beta-Cyclodextrin (beta-CD) amended hydrous ironzirconium hybrid oxide (CHIZO), which is a new type of surface modified highly selective composite in organic-inorganic frameworks, is synthesized and characterized using various state of the art analytical tools, and its efficacy on fluoride removal from an aqueous solution is explored. The agglomerated micro structured composite material has no significant fingerprint such as surface appearance in TEM images and is inclined to possess very poor crystallinity. The BET analysis of CHIZO reveals a surface area of 0.2070 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 0.0476 cm(3) g(-1). The highly pH dependent fluoride adsorption by CHIZO decreases with an increase in pH, and pseudo-second order kinetics control the reaction.

The thermodynamically spontaneous nature of CHIZO is due to the exothermic nature of the reaction. In addition, phosphate and sulphate show an adverse effect on fluoride adsorption. beta-CD forms inclusion complexes by taking up fluoride ions from water into its central cavity and the driving forces associated with the complex formation include the release of enthalpy-rich water molecules from its cavity, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and release of conformational strain. The poor regeneration of the spent adsorbent even in 1.0 M NaOH (below 20%) is probably a consequence of entrapping fluoride inside the cavity of beta-CD with hydrogen bonding. It has been found that only 0.9 g of CHIZO is able to reduce the fluoride level to below 1.0 mg L-1 in one-litre of fluoride spiked (5.0 mg L-1) natural water sample.

The fouled surface of the PVDF membrane suppressed the adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants due to the improved hydrophilicity, and prevented hydrophilic pollutants from entering the membrane pores due to hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and counterion effects.

CuCl2 has been chosen as a polymerizing agent for the oxidative chemical polymerization process. The prepared polymer semiconductor has become an ideal system to explore this outstanding recipe of chemistry and physics. Formation of polaron and bipolaron defect energy states in the polymer lattice facilitates exceptional electrical hole transport through the polymer chain, providing an electrical sheet resistance varying from 5.0 x 10(5) Omega square(-1) to 2.8 x 10(7) Omega square(-1). The optical band gap as obtained from the absorbance study was found to be in the range of 2.49 eV to 2.62 eV, which is suitable for the design of semiconductor devices. Most importantly, this article reports an effective way of tuning the optical and electrical properties of the prepared semiconductor, achieved through controlling the degree of oxidation during polymerization and thus bringing a control over the defect energy states.

Among the existing nacre structures, GO sheets were mostly used as hard inorganic components as those in nacre to improve the mechanical properties. Here, a novel nanoconfined electrodeposition process was explored to fabricate nacre-like Cu2O/graphene oxide (GO) thin films, where GO nanosheets functioned as the soft organic components in nacre. The inter-layer spaces between the GO nanosheets were used as templates for the growth of single crystalline Cu2O nanolayers, with thicknesses of several to tens of nanometers, though Cu2O belongs to the cubic phase. Due to the small lattice mismatch between the (1 (1) over bar0) plane of Cu2O and the (001) plane of GO, the Cu2O nanolayers most likely grew on the (001) plane of GO. The resulting nacre-like thin film demonstrates a 6 times greater hardness and a 3 times greater Young's modulus, than those of pure GO thin films. This technique provides a promising route for the synthesis of nacre-like metal (metal-oxide)/GO composites.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Floc structural characteristics of ferrum-polymer dual-coagulant for treatment of synthetic dyes wastewater: effect of solution pH, hardness and ionic strength", "Abstract": "In this study, a cationic lignin-based flocculant (LBF) was prepared and used with polyferric chloride (PFC) to treat disperse and reactive dyes wastewater. The effects of dosage, initial pH, hardness and ionic strength on the interactions and floc properties were studied. Results showed that hydroxyl and quaternary ammonium groups of LBF could combine with -NH- and sulfo groups of dyes. Large flocs with extended structure were formed due to the absorption bridging and charge neutralization effect of LBF. The maximum color removal ratios achieved by PFC + LBF dual-coagulant were 94.1% and 95.6% in the treatment of disperse yellow and reactive blue wastewater, respectively. Solution pH had a significant effect on floc size and compactness by the variance of Fe(III) hydrolysates and charge of LBF. Moderate hardness and ionic strength both could improve floc properties but the mechanisms were different: Ca2+ ions could combine with hydroxyl and sulfo groups to produce chelates and decrease the electric repulsion simultaneously, Na+ ions only compressed the electric double layer. Excess hardness and ionic strength showed a slight influence because of the limited binding sites and strong electric repulsion, respectively.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Catalytic removal of organic colorants from water using some transition metal oxide nanoparticles synthesized under sunlight", "Abstract": "Transition metal oxides (TMO) constitute a most amazing class of materials with a wide range of properties and applications; therefore, their synthesis using a green approach is a necessity. As such, sunlight irradiation was employed to synthesize various TMO nanostructures (ZnO, CuO, Co3O4, NiO and Cr2O3) using water as a solvent. Nanoparticles obtained with distinct morphologies, such as nanotubes (ZnO; <35 nm), nanorods (CuO; 7-50 nm), nanorods, triangles and hexagons (Co3O4; 45-90 nm), needle-shaped (NiO; 2-25 nm) and nanobeads (Cr2O3; similar to 17 nm) were confirmed by TEM analysis. The significance of the synthesis is in its quick approach with no thermal heat involvement, reusable catalyst, cost effectiveness and ability to fabricate almost uniformly distributed nanoparticles with small sizes. The potential of the synthesized nanoparticles was examined in the treatment of simulated water containing hazardous dyes: Alizarin Red S (ARS) + Methylene Blue (MB).

This was achieved via direct writing of graphite pencil on cellulose paper which involves the deposition of few layers to multi layers of conductive graphene flakes intercalated by clay and wax. The temperature sensor exhibits a negative temperature coefficient of resistance of -4232 ppm K-1, which is comparable to that of conventional temperature sensors (platinum, nickel, and copper) that are fabricated by capital intensive and complex procedures. The dynamic response of the temperature sensor shows its repeatability with excellent response time of 13.5 s. The all-carbon pH sensor could efficiently distinguish acidic, alkaline and neutral solutions with significant sensitivity from 1.77 k Omega pH(-1) to 2.21 k Omega pH(-1). The higher sensitivity of the pH sensor is attributed to the oxygen functional groups present in pencil graphite which undergoes protonation and deprotonation in presence of H+ and OH- ions to alter the conductivity of graphite trace. The interdigitated capacitive humidity sensor shows a linear response to humidity with fast response (1.5-2 s) and recovery times (6-7 s). These fast response and recovery times are due to fast adsorption and evaporation kinetics of water molecules on polar OH groups of cellulose fibers in paper, which depends on porosity of the paper. The versatility of the pencil-on-paper approach was further explored by drawing resistor and interdigitated capacitor in series to fabricate in-plane all-carbon RC filter which demonstrate anticipated functionality with a cut-off frequency of 6 kHz.

Three fractions (fractions 1#, 2#, and 3#) of phenolic compounds with high added-value were extracted with water-organic solvent from liquefied oil via a stepwise fractionation process. The structural features of three phenolic compounds and depolymerized lignin were analyzed and identified by a combination of heteronuclear single quantum correlation-nuclear magnetic resonance, gel permeation chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, showing interesting functionalities for biochemical and biofuel applications. In this investigation, guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxybenzoate (PB) aromatics were the basic units of three phenolic compound fractions. Etherified syringyl aromatics were evident in fractions 1# and 3#. There were only single-aromatic-ring units (such as G and PB units) in phenolic compound fraction 2#. In the aromatic region, the absence of beta-O-4' ether linkage, resinol, and phenylcoumaran units in three phenolic compound fractions indicated that depolymerization of lignin occurred during the liquefied biomass process. The molecular weights of three phenolic compound fractions were significantly different (797, 249, and 497, respectively) along with fractions 1#, 2#, and 3#. The phenolic compounds could be separated into a high, lower, and lowest molecular weight fraction in this study.

In the adsorption process, Cr(VI) was initially adsorbed on the CS/PA6 layer (intermediate layer), followed by the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by the -NH2 of CS. The photocatalytic process was driven by the reductive pathway with faster degradation rate due to the electron donation from PA6 to SiW12.

The appropriate HA/EDC/NHS-crosslinking time for SF nanofibrous matrices was 24 hours. The strain performance of the as-crosslinked SF nanofibers increased with an increase in HA concentration, with the optimal HA concentration being 0.3% (w/v).

The CNF-reinforced silica aerogels were prepared through the elaboration of silica particles interpenetrated with a nanocellulosic network structure by immersion of the CNF aerogels into a silica solution in a two-step sol-gel process (first, hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and second, condensation under alkaline conditions). The relationships among the silica content, the density, and the compressive properties of the composite aerogels were investigated. A response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the preparation process (CNF concentration, TEOS concentration, pH value of condensation process and immersion time) with the target being to synthesize a desired aerogel with improved mechanical properties. The results show that density can be seen as a function of the silica content, and that the two had a positive dependent relationship. The compressive properties were also greatly affected by the silica loading into the cellulosic scaffold. The composite aerogel displayed high compressive properties at 40-50 wt% silica particles. The optimal condition would be a CNF aerogel of 5% solid content immersed into a 2.5 mol L-1 TEOS sol with condensation at pH value of 10 for 10 min. The compressive modulus (6.57 MPa) and compressive strength (1.37 MPa) of the composite aerogel greatly exceeded those of the pure silica aerogel, without substantial increases in density (0.1 g cm(-3)). The composite aerogel also had good insulation properties (thermal conductivity was 0.0226 W m(-1) K-1) and hydrophobicity (contact angle 152.1 degrees) and thus can be considered as a multi-functional aerogel capable of applications in a wide variety of areas.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Efficient dual acidic carbo-catalyst for one-pot conversion of carbohydrates to levulinic acid", "Abstract": "Levulinic acid (LA) is an important platform intermediate for several high value renewable bioproducts.

In these interesting structures, rod blocks align parallel to the pore axis and the axial component of the mean square end-to-end distance of rod blocks is generally bigger than that in the bulk. At last, a morphological phase diagram in terms of the block length and the pore diameter is obtained.

The production of drop-in alkanes is a preferable short term strategy because of its practical implementation and integration in existing infrastructure and processes. A handful of promising cellulose-to-alkane biorefinery initiatives were recently reported, both processing in gas and liquid phase. This contribution presents a detailed study of the two-liquid phase hydrodeoxygenation of cellulose to n-hexane under relatively mild circumstances, proceeding through the recently communicated HMF route, in presence of a soluble acid and Ru/C metal catalyst. Two main points were addressed here: (i) the importance (or not) of the lignocellulose pretreatment and purification to the alkane yield, and (ii) the renewability of the consumed hydrogen in the process. A systematic study of the effect of cellulose purity, crystallinity, degree of polymerization and particle size (surface area) on the light naphtha yield was performed to tackle the first part. As fibrous cellulose with large particles was the most favourable feedstock with regard to alkane yield and as the presence of hemicellulose and lignin impurities had no effect on the cellulose-tonaphtha conversion, costly mechanical and purification steps are redundant to the process, in contrast to their notable importance in other cellulose valorisation processes (e.g. to glucose, sorbitol, isosorbide and acids). The second point regarding sustainable hydrogen supply is discussed in detail by calculating hydrogen and carbon mass and energy balances of the chemical conversions, assuming selected scenarios among others to recuperate the hydrogen by steam-reforming of waste streams (like gaseous C-<6 hydrocarbons and aqueous polyol fractions) and (partial) aromatization of the C-6 fraction into benzene.

This is partly due to the lack of a generic platform that integrates all of the necessary operations for end-users, and partly to the increasing complexity that emerges as several operations are combined together. Here we report the development of a platform that provides the capabilities of multiwell plates in a two-dimensional array of nanoliter droplets: encapsulation, time-resolved monitoring and variation of well contents, as well as the ability to selectively extract the contents of any of the wells. We demonstrate these capabilities by encapsulating thousands of individual bacterial cells in droplets that are stored on a two-dimensional array of surface-energy anchors. Bacterial culture can be performed either in liquid or hydrogel droplets, both of which allow precise quantification using either standard measurements or digital enumeration. Using hydrogels allows the removal of the external oil that surrounds the aqueous drops, for instance in order to apply a gradient of antibiotics across the droplet population. This defines a protocol to obtain an antibiogram in a single experiment. Finally, the liquid to gel transition provides a robust way to selectively extract any droplet from the array, by melting it with a focused laser. When combined with further off-chip culture or genotyping, this platform provides a unique culturing environment to relate phenotype and genotype measurements on monoclonal colonies.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Corrosive behaviour of implant biomaterials in oral environment", "Abstract": "The major groups of implantable materials in dentistry are metals and alloys, ceramics and polymeric materials.

The replacement of traditional fossil fuels with limited reserves by alternative energy sources has become one of the main strategies to alleviate the increasingly serious environmental issues. As a sustainable and promising store of renewable energy, lithium-ion batteries have replaced other types of batteries for many small-scale consumer devices. Notwithstanding their worldwide applications, it has become abundantly clear that the design and fabrication of electrode materials is urgently required to adapt to meet the growing global demand for energy and the power densities needed to make electric vehicles fully commercially viable. To dramatically enhance battery performance, further advances in materials chemistry are essential, especially in novel nanomaterials chemistry. The construction of nanostructured cathode materials by reducing particle size can boost electrochemical performance.

The metal coated extent, dispersion extent of micro/nano cellulose fibres and crystalline structure of Ni-P/nano-SiC composite coatings were investigated. The homogeneous hollow composite coatings and metal coated extent of micro/nano cellulose fibres were improved with increase in concentration of nano-SiC in the coatings, and the ideal composite coatings were obtained within the range of 0.2 to 0.35 g (0.6 g/l) nano-SiC in the solution bath. The metallisation for cellulose fibres enhanced the dispersion extent of micro-nano cellulose fibres. A uniform coating, consisting of the hollow coating on cellulose fibres surface, could be obtained. At the same time, metallisation did not damage the original structure and surface functional groups of the cellulose fibres. The concentration of nano-SiC, ultrasonic time, ultrasonic power and cellulose concentration had a direct influence on the metal coated extent on the surface of cellulose fibres: The coated extent, dispersion extent and crystalline structure of metallisation cellulose fibres would exhibit ideal characteristics.

Moreover, the fully biobased crosslinked organic aerogel possessed excellent mechanical properties based on both compression and three-point bending tests. For instance, it exhibited a remarkable compressive modulus (up to 10 MPa) along the vertical direction (parallel to the freezing direction) as well as a high flexural modulus (up to 54 MPa) perpendicular to the freezing direction. The effects of different aerogel densities and CNF contents on the mechanical properties of CMC/CNF aerogels have been studied. With increasing aerogel density or CNF content, the modulus and strength of the CMC/CNF aerogel increased in both compression and three-point bending tests. In addition, these cellulose aerogels also exhibited relatively low thermal conductivities (<54 mW m(-1) K-1).

Here, we used hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a model antigen for the formulation of an intranasal chitosan-based vaccine against hepatitis B. In vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to evaluate its efficacy and explore the possible underlying mechanism of action. Our results showed that HBsAg was efficiently encapsulated within chitosan particles, and that the strong adhesive effect of the positive charges on the particle surface prolonged the residence in the nasal cavity. The insolubility of chitosan particles in physiological pH enabled the formation of a sustained-release depot in extracellular fluids, whereas their solubility in aqueous acids facilitated the escape of the encapsulated antigen from lysosomes, thereby enabling cross-presentation. Chitosan was able to open epithelial-cell tight junctions, thus allowing the entry of free antigens. In addition, chitosan enhanced the uptake of antigens by dendritic cells and promoted their maturation. In vivo results showed that intranasal delivery of chitosan particles induced significantly higher levels of cellular and mucosal immunity than did injected alum-based vaccine.

In addition, organic acids supported a higher V(v) removal than alcohols, thus achieving the highest V(v) removal efficiency of 75.6% using acetate during a 12 h operation, compared with lactate, glucose, citrate and soluble starch. A higher initial V(v) concentration led to a lower V(v) removal efficiency, while the extra addition of organics had little effect on its improvement. With an increase in the pH and conductivity, the V(v) removal efficiency first increased and then decreased. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing analysis indicated the accumulation of Actinobacteria, Chlorobaculum of Chlorobi and Proteiniphilum of Bacteroidetes, which might be responsible for the function of the proposed system.

It was found that they could self-assemble into organogels in some mixed solvents rapidly upon stimulation by ultrasound. Although the emission of CCBM and TCBM in solutions was very weak, the xerogel-based films emitted intense yellow light under UV irradiation on account of AIE (aggregation-induced emission). It was further proved by the fact that the aggregates emitted strong yellow light in THF/water with high water fraction, while they were almost non-emissive in THF. We found that the emission of CCBM and TCBM in THF/water with high water fraction could be quenched by TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) significantly, so these hydrophobic dyes could be applied to detect acids in water phase. It should be noted that the emission of the nanofibers-based films of CCBM and TCBM could also be quenched rapidly upon exposed to TFA vapor. Particularly, the thinner the film, the higher the performance detected for the sensory properties. For example, the detection limit and the decay time of CCBM towards gaseous TFA in nanofibers-based film with the thickness of 0.21 mu m were 0.33 ppm and 0.38 s, respectively, and those were 8.0 ppm and 2.5 s for the film with the thickness of 1.73 mu m.

The aim of this work was to develop a suitable method for extracting the off flavor free red radish root anthocyanin, while conserving high anthocyanin yield. Results showed that phosphoric and citric acidified hexane (pH 2.5) extracts yielded maximum anthocyanin levels of 208.37 mg/100 g and 202.89 mg/100 g fresh radish, respectively with lower percentage polymeric color and higher color density, chroma and hue angle compared to other extracts at different pH values. Tentative anthocyanin identification by UPLC-TQ-MS showed 12 glycosylated anthocyanins substituted at C3 and C5 in phosphoric acidified extracts and only 10 in citric acidified extracts. In addition, analysis of total glucosinolates (GSLs) revealed significant inhibition of glucosinolate degradation in acidified hexane extracts (pH 2.5) compared to the other extracts. The off flavor evaluated by GC-MS revealed a significant decrease of isothiocyanates, sulfides and nitrogen containing compounds in acidified hexane (pH 2.5) compared to other extracts. Furthermore, dehydration and rehydration of extracts showed that over 70% of off flavor compounds could be removed in two phases (aqueous and hexane) during hexane removal. Results of sensory evaluation confirmed that the red radish root anthocyanin from the phosphoric acidified hexane (pH 2.5) was closer to the color and odor characteristics of the commercial red radish anthocyanin.

This study addressed whether protein in a microwave field would generate free radicals, and which factors affect the formation and stability of the free radicals. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the signal of radicals in microwave-treated rice protein. The results revealed carbon-centred radicals in the treated rice protein samples. Spectral analysis of the rice protein revealed the presence of radicals not only in the thermally treated samples, but also in native samples of rice protein. The growth of radicals was strongly influenced by the water activity. Under microwave radiation, the intensity of the protein radicals increased as the water activity decreased and the microwave power increased. The intensity and growth rate increased with the radiation time. During storage time, the signal of the radicals dropped to 85% of the original value within 1 h. However, the radical signal gradually increased to its original level by the fifth day. Then, the EPR signal continued to decline at a slow pace until the intensity decreased to 75% of the original level. Based on the heating characteristics of oven heating, a temperature-controlled program during microwave heating was designed to compare the intensity of radicals after the two heating methods.

Previous progress in the understanding of cellular mechanosensitivity has been closely linked to the availability of artificial cell substrates of adjustable viscoelasticity, allowing for a direct correlation between substrate stiffness and cell response. Exemplary, polymeric gel substrates with polymer-conjugated cell-substrate linkers provided valuable insight into the role of mechanical signals during cell migration in an extracellular matrix environment. In contrast, less is known about the role of external mechanical signals across cell-cell interfaces, in part, due to the limitations of traditional polymeric substrates to mimic the remarkable dynamics of cell-cell linkages. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a cell surface-mimicking cell substrate of adjustable stiffness, which is comprised of a polymer-tethered lipid multi-bilayer stack with N-cadherin linkers. Unlike traditional polymeric cell substrates with polymer-conjugated linkers, this novel artificial cell substrate is able to replicate the dynamic assembly/disassembly of cadherin linkers into linker clusters and the long-range movements of cadherin-based cell-substrate linkages observed at cell-cell interfaces. Moreover, substrate stiffness can be changed by adjusting the number of bilayers in the multi-bilayer stack, thus enabling the analysis of cellular mechanosensitivity in the presence of artificial cell-cell linkages.

Strategies to disrupt the structure of crystallised lipid in aqueous solution at lower temperatures are much needed, where nanoparticle-based strategies show enormous promise. Using the aqueous tristearin bilayer as a model for crystallised lipid, we demonstrate that the synergistic use of surfactant and detonation nanodiamonds can depress the onset temperature at which disruption of the crystallised lipid structure occurs. Our simulations reveal the molecular-scale mechanisms by which this disruption takes place, indicating that the nanodiamonds serve a dual purpose. First, the nanodiamonds are predicted to facilitate delivery of surfactant to the lipid/water interface, and second, nanodiamond adsorption acts to roughen the lipid/water interface, enhancing ingress of surfactant into the bilayer. We find the balance of the hydrophobic surface area of the nanodiamond and the nanodiamond surface charge density to be a key determinant of the effectiveness of using nanodiamonds to facilitate lipid disruption.

The microstructure of the bonding zone showed no metallurgical discontinuity such as eutectic microstructure or intermetallic Al-Cu phases. However the microstructure shows numerous voids with a size of approximately 30 mu m in the bonding zone. It is assumed that these voids were formed during the bonding process due to solidification shrinkage and the presence of interfacial oxide layers. The transient liquid phase bonded samples that were mechanically tested under tensile load showed an average strength of approximately 270MPa, the minimum yield strength required for the base material according to EN 754-2 is 255MPa.

To date, a commonly employed approach to depolymerize the polysaccharides in plant cell walls employs mineral acids, and upgrading strategies for the resulting sugars are under intense development. Although the behavior of cellulose and hemicellulose is reasonably well characterized, a more thorough understanding of lignin depolymerization mechanisms in acid environments is necessary to predict the fate of lignin under such conditions and ultimately to potentially make lignin a viable feedstock. To this end, dilute acid hydrolysis experiments were performed on two lignin model compounds containing the alpha-O-4 ether linkage at two temperatures concomitant with dilute acid pretreatment. Both primary and secondary products were tracked over time, giving insight into the reaction kinetics. The only difference between the two model compounds was the presence or absence of a methyl group on the alpha-carbon, with the former being typical of native lignin. It was found that methylation of the alpha-carbon increases the rate of reaction by an order of magnitude. Density functional theory calculations were performed on a proposed mechanism initiated by a nucleophilic attack on the alpha-carbon by water with a commensurate protonation of the ether oxygen. The values for the thermodynamics and kinetics derived from these calculations were used as the basis for a microkinetic model of the reaction. Results from this model are in good agreement with the experimental kinetic data for both lignin model compounds and provide useful insight into the primary pathways of alpha-O-4 scission reactions in acid-catalyzed lignin depolymerization. The distribution of primary and secondary products is interpreted as a function of two barriers of formation exhibiting opposite trends upon methylation of the alpha-carbon (one barrier is lowered while the other is increased).

The key elements involve the application of a pulse of strong shear and controlled crystallization. Specifically, the shear featuring a short duration of 1 s and a shear rate high to 100 s(-1) was employed to create shish precursors, which was followed by high-temperature crystallization (at 130, 135, and 140 degrees C) to render the prevailing development of shish-kebabs rather than spherulites. The direct observation of the overgrown shish afforded the demonstration of its origin from shear-aligned bundles of fibrillar chains, implying the crucial importance of chain entanglements in driving the alignment of neighboring chains along the transient shear. For the first time, the shear-aligned shish was revealed to present much higher conformational order, compared to the neighboring kebabs or spherulites. It is of great interest that the application of transient shear flow prevented PLLA from shear-induced degradation, although the PLLA chains are inherently sensitive to external shear stress. The proposed pathway, thus, creates PLLA rich in shish-kebabs with well-preserved high-molecular-weight chains. This signifies a new scenario with respect to previous studies where strong and long-acting shear was required for the formation of oriented structures in PLLA and the property enhancement was to large part hampered by simultaneous chain scissions.

Beech lamellas with dimensions of 5 mm x 20 mm x 150 mm were prepared from beech lumbers using a planer saw. The UF adhesive (E0 class) was mixed with the MFC using a magnetic stirrer to achieve a proper distribution of the MFC in the UF adhesive. The tensile shear strength of single lap-joint specimens bonded with UF adhesive containing MFC was determined in accordance with EN 205 (2003). The specimens bonded with UF adhesive containing the MFC showed better tensile shear strengths as compared to the control. As compared to the control specimens, the tensile shear strength of the specimens increased by 5.7% as 3 wt% of the MFC incorporated into the UF adhesive. However, further increment in the MFC content up to 5 wt% decreased the tensile shear strength of the specimens (-14.3% of control specimen). The MFCs were well dispersed in the UF resin and were cross-linked to form a network to reinforce the bond line, improving bonding performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we systematically investigated the influence of cholesterol analog 6-ketocholestanol (6-KC) on the dehydration of model cell membrane, using sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. In pure DI water environment, two separate dehydration dynamic components were observed in neutrally charged and isotopically labeled 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and positively charged 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine(chloride salt) (DMEPC) bilayer: a large-amplitude fast component and a small-amplitude slow component, which originated from the water molecules with a weak and a strong water-membrane bound strengths, respectively. Dehydration of a negatively charged mixed DMPC/DMPG bilayer lead to the membrane-bound water being reorganized to ordered structures quickly. It is evident that the water-membrane bound strengths depend largely on the charge status of the lipid and has an order of neutrally charged membrane << positively charged membrane << negatively charged membrane. In an ionic environment, KCl solution can not only dehydrate DMPC bilayer, but also prevent the 6-KC from further dehydrating this model cell membrane. We observed that the dehydration dynamics behavior of DMPC bilayer in the presence of the chaotropic anions is similar to that of the negatively charged DMPG bilayer because of the penetration of chaotropic anions into the DMPC bilayer.

Despite some motivation in the literature and the ongoing search for abundant and non-toxic thermoelectric materials, the first experimental study on a set of eight substrate-free boron-doped nanocrystalline diamond foils is presented herein. All transport coefficients were determined in the same direction within the same foils over a broad temperature range up to 900 degrees C. It is found that nanostructuring reduces the thermal conductivity by two orders of magnitude, but the mobility decreases significantly to around 1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), too. Although degenerate transport can be concluded from the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, charge carriers notably scatter at grain boundaries where sp(2)-carbon modifications and amorphous boron-rich phases form during synthesis. A detailed analysis of doping efficiency yields an acceptor fraction of only 8-18 at%, meaning that during synthesis excess boron thermodynamically prefers electrically inactive sites.

Although wind turbines are typically designed for a service life of about 20 years, robust structural maintenance and repair procedures are essential to ensure the structural integrity of wind turbines and prevent catastrophic failures. Wind blades are damaged due to demanding mechanical loads (e.g., static and fatigue), environmental conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) and also manufacturing defects. If material damage is not extensive, structural repair is the only viable option to restore strength since replacing the entire blade is not cost-effective, especially for larger blades.

Smart polymers have been developed for diverse purposes ranging from commodities to high-tech medical applications. In particular, bio-based polymers have attracted increasing attention because of environmental concerns and the realization that global petroleum resources are finite. A great quantity of these polymers has been synthesized, and more will be produced in the future. Therefore, their characterization requires various analytical instruments and methods. This article presents the most comprehensive overview of basic operational principles of various advanced hyphenated techniques for polymer analysis and characterization and to present several literature examples of applications of these techniques. An overview of polymer classification and characterization in terms of physico-chemical, mechanical, thermal, and viscoelastic properties is initially introduced. Next, the polymer characterization by conventional thermal analysis is discussed. Hyphenated analytical technique is online coupling of separation and detection techniques using suitable interfaces. Here, the main focus of this review article will discuss recent advances in the online applications of various hyphenated techniques such as double-, triple-, and quadruple-hyphenated methods along with appropriate examples. This should be the first review article simultaneously introduced and discussed overall above three techniques, rather than only one or two techniques presented in other review article. These hyphenated techniques offer shorter analysis times, increased automation, higher sample throughput, better reproducibility, and reduced contamination. The remarkable improvements observed in these methods are expected to enhance combined selectivity and increase the amount of authentic information obtained. When the hyphenated analytical techniques are combined, however, there will be having synergies and negative consequences. Details on the advantages and disadvantages of the hyphenated coupling techniques should be paid more and more attention on the investigation of polymeric materials.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Optical properties of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) aggregates from fully atomistic investigations", "Abstract": "We report on a first-principle theoretical investigation of the optical absorption and emission spectra of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) aggregates by means of a multiscale all-atom hybrid approach, which combines: (i) molecular dynamics simulations of (intrachain) conformational and (interchain) positional disorder, (ii) quantum-chemical calculations of intrachain excited states and excitonic interactions, and (iii) solving of a Frenkel-Holstein model that includes coupling of the electronic excitations to a dominant high-frequency molecular vibration.

This study evaluated microwave irradiation in the presence of nano-and macro-scale graphitic additives as a rapid remediation technology for removing heavy hydrocarbons from soil. Adding inert materials (i.e., glass wool fibers or washed silica sand) as controls had no effect on total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) removal upon microwave irradiation. Carbonaceous nanomaterials (i.e., carbon nanotubes, graphene nanosheets, and carbon nanofibers) because of their favorable dielectric properties showed extraordinary heating performances when mixed with soil and microwave irradiated. As a result, adding these carbonaceous nanomaterials to contaminated soils removed more TPH compared with macro-scale carbonaceous additives. TPH concentrations decreased from 11 000 to between 2000 and 6000 mg TPH kg(-1) soil within one minute using carbon nanomaterial additives and a 2.45 GHz, 1000 W conventional microwave oven. In separate experiments, this technology decreased TPH from 2500 to 650 mg TPH kg(-1) soil from soils containing recalcitrant, non-biodegradable fractions of TPH.

To date, the stability of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) materials is not well understood. We examined the electrokinetic properties and aggregation kinetics of three RGOs synthesized by reducing graphene oxide (GO) with N2H4, NaBH4, and L-ascorbic acid. In NaCl solution, the critical coagulation concentrations of the materials correlated reasonably with their C/O ratios. However, the increased aggregation tendency of RGOs was caused mainly by their increased hydrophobicity rather than decreased surface charge negativity. For both monovalent and divalent cations, less densely hydrated cations were more effective in causing aggregation than more densely hydrated cations (e.g., K+ vs. Na+, and Ca2+ vs. Mg2+) owing to the greater efficiency of the former in neutralizing surface charges and the bridging effect in the case of Ca2+. The RGOs exhibited high stability in artificial surface water, whereas different degrees of aggregation were observed in artificial groundwater. Strikingly, in artificial groundwater the aggregation tendency of the materials correlated poorly with the degree of reduction but strongly with the types and concentrations of surface O functionalities, which determined the nature and strength of interactions between RGO and cations in solution.

Many nanotechnologies employ resource-limited materials, such as precious metals and rare earth elements that ultimately end up as nanowaste. To make nanotechnology more sustainable it is essential to develop strategies to recover these high-value, resource-limited materials. To address this complex issue, we developed laboratory-scale methods to recover nanowaste gold. To this end, a-cyclodextrin facilitated host-guest inclusion complex formation involving secondsphere coordination of [AuBr4](-) and [K(OH2)(6)](+) was used for gold recovery and the recovered gold was then used to produce new nanoparticles. To quantify the environmental impacts of this gold recycling process we then produced life cycle assessments to compare nanoparticulate gold production scenarios with and without recycling.

Control of size, shape, and phase stability is a challenge for many nano-iron-based technologies, especially those involving Fe-0 that is susceptible to oxidation under ambient conditions. This article presents a continuous method for hybridizing Fe-based nanoparticles with carbon in the form of graphene-encapsulated Fe-based particles with core-shell symmetry that allows flexible control of iron particle size, shape, and phase stability. The method uses FeOOH nanorods and graphene oxide as precursors, and subjects them to an aerosol-phase microdroplet drying and annealing process to yield a range of Fe/C nano-hybrids whose structure can be controlled through adjustment of aerosol process temperature and postsynthesis thermal treatment conditions. We demonstrate that FeOOH nanorods can be successfully encapsulated in graphene, and transform during annealing into encapsulated Fe3O4 or Fe-0 nanoparticles by reductive fragmentation, where the graphene nanosack acts as a carbothermic reductant. The hybrids are characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry and Cr(VI) removal rates in aqueous media. The Fe-0 - graphene hybrids show high activity, good stability, and good recyclability in aqueous Cr(VI) removal due to the effect of graphene encapsulation.

Herein, we focus on the development of a series of hybrid materials consisting of cobalt nickel phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) decorated carbon nanotubes (Co2-xNixP/CNTs) as efficient catalysts for enhanced HER catalytic activity. All the X-ray spectra including X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy demonstrate that the crystalline phase structure, valence and coordination environment of hexagonal Ni2P are changed with increasing Co atoms. Electrochemical measurements show that the Co2-xNixP/CNT hybrids exhibit high activity and stability for the HER in acidic solution. The as-synthesized Co1.6Ni0.4P/CNT hybrid exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity with low onset overpotential (36.1 mV), a small Tafel slope (46.7 mV dec(-1)), a much larger exchange current density (1.86 x 10(-5) A cm(-2)), lower HER activation energy (57.3 kJ mol(-1)), and good stability. Such enhanced catalytic activity originates from the introduction of Co and strong synergistic effects between CNTs and Co2-xNixP. Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations also confirm that the higher HER catalytic activity of the Co2-xNixP/CNTs can be attributed to the splendid migratory aptitude of adsorbed single H atoms and the lower energy barrier for H-2 formation after the introduction of Co atoms.

After the irradiation of the 915 nm laser (intensity: 2.0 W cm(-2)), the temperature of the dispersion goes up to higher than 42 degrees C (LCST of PNA-CS), resulting in the release of the drug. As a result, the cumulative release of DOX from PNA-CS-PPy-DOX increases from 1.67% (at 0 min) to 48.53% (at 14 min of irradiation), indicating the excellent intelligence and controllability. Subsequently, the PNA-CS-PPy-DOX dispersion is injected into the tumor of the mice. Under the irradiation of the 915 nm laser, the cancer cells can be efficiently destroyed, and the tumor suffers significant ablation, indicating the excellent synergic photothermal-/chemo-therapy effects compared with the single photothermal therapy or chemotherapy effect.

Cellulose is dissolved in Nmethylmorpholine-N-oxide at high temperature, which can destroy the hydrogen bonds among the cellulose molecules and activate hydroxyls. At the same time, some of the hydroxyl groups are gradually oxidized to carboxyl in this process, which effectively reacts with the CDs, whose surface is functionalized by lots of amide groups. The result from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirms that there is strong interaction between cellulose and the CDs due to the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds through dehydration-condensation reactions. In addition, the composite phosphor retains the inherent properties of individual CDs and emits 450 nm blue light, however an interesting excitation dependent phenomenon is observed. Finally, the temperature dependent fluorescent properties of the cellulose/CDs phosphors have been investigated from 200 to 420 K.

Prominent photocurrent response was observed from a simple photovoltaic assembly prepared by encapsulating the hydrogel within two electrodes. For a better understanding of the energy transport, the hybrid systems were synthesized via two different methods (in situ and swelling induced). The difference in photocurrent efficiency among the two systems could be correlated with the different dynamic behaviors of the various excitonic packets and could be explained with environment-assisted transport of photosynthesis (ENAQT). This theory predicts that energy migration in a natural photosystem relies on the balance between coherence and dephasing, owing to the respective packing geometry. Fluorescence anisotropy supports the swollen induced arrangement of chlorophyll-a packets, which are inter-connected in terms of overlapping in site energy, as evident from the broadening of the UV-Vis spectra wherein coherent spreading occurs among around 4 chlorophyll-a molecules, as revealed from the time correlated single photon count. Exciton localization within the packets is destroyed by low frequency noise to mitigate coherence trapping in a coherent classical intermediate fashion, similar to ENAQT in natural photosynthesis, resulting in greater photocurrent efficiency. Optical and photo-physical properties of the in situ sample show that charged dimers are randomly spread throughout the system. As a result, delocalization is destroyed and energy propagation becomes less effective as the exciton is more likely to recombine than trap. The experimental signature of the environment-assisted energy transfer is further supported by a simple mathematical formulation inspired from Kassal's work. The concept of using swollen induced bio-inspired soft materials for solar energy harvesting can pave the way towards a new class of biomimetic solar cell.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Biofriendly ionic liquids for starch plasticization: a screening approach", "Abstract": "A series of cholinium cation-based bioionic liquids (BioILs) were synthetized with the aim of screening their performance as potential plasticizers of thermoplastic starch.

Etoposide (VP-16), a widely-used chemotherapy drug with poor water solubility, could be incorporated into the inner core of hydrophobic CS to form FA-CS(VP-16)-g-PSBMA nanoparticles. The synthesis of the nanocarrier was verified by using zeta potential analysis, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectra. Next, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the release behavior, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticles. Our results showed FA-CS(VP-16)-g-PSBMA nanoparticles released VP-16 more effectively in acidic phosphate-buffered saline than that under neutral conditions, and could be effectively internalized into HeLa cells. Compared to the nanoparticles without FA, FA-CS(VP-16)-g-PSBMA nanoparticles exhibited a more significant inhibitory effect on HeLa cell viability in vitro. When HeLa tumor-bearing mice were intravenously administrated with fluorescence-labelled nanoparticles, FA-conjugated nanoparticles accumulated more rapidly at the tumor site.

The present work proposes a simple way to control the formaldehyde generation by a reactive blending with bisphenol-A and amine to form in situ benzoxazines via the Mannich reaction. Further thermal treatment leads to partial conversion of benzoxazines (BA-a) to polybenzoxazines (poly(BA-a)) and the POM-poly(BA-a) obtained is under a semi-interpenetrating network. At that time, the BA-a and poly(BA-a) reached the amorphous phase to induce an increase in elongation at break. When POM blends were electrospun, the molecular orientation of POM was induced and this synergistically functions with the poly( BA-a) network, resulting in an increase in tensile strength which never occurs in the bulk material.

Hydrophilic silanol groups (Si-OH) on its surface, however, can attract moisture, thereby causing an undesirable increase in the dielectric constant. Modification of the exposed hydrophilic surface to a hydrophobic functional group provides one solution to this problem. We report here a strategy for converting surface Si-OH to hydrophobic silicon hydride (Si-H) without affecting the internal oxide network in CDO. The approach involves esterification of the exposed silanol to its triflate (silyltrifluoromethanesulfonate, Si-O-Tf), followed by reduction to Si-H with diisobutylaluminum hydride. Si-H is further modified by a photochemical reaction with an alkene (1-octadecene) to yield Si-R (R = -C18H37) to provide a more moisture resistant, and less polar Si-C as opposed to the Si-O backbone. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), and measurements of the contact angle with water substantiated the successful conversion. The reaction scheme is versatile, transforming silanol groups to silicon hydride in widely varying chemical sites, from small molecules to the surfaces of silica gels, SiOx and CDO wafers.

Theoretical models have been fragmented and incomplete with respect to their counterparts for free-solution electrophoresis. This paper unifies electrokinetic models that address complex nanoparticle corona architectures, corona and gel charge regulation (e.g., by the local pH), multi-component electrolytes, and non-linear electrostatics and relaxation effects. By comprehensively addressing the electrokinetic aspects of the more general gel-electrophoresis problem, in which short-ranged steric interactions are significant, a stage is set to better focus on the physicochemical and steric factors. In this manner, it is envisioned that noparticle gel-electrophoresis may eventually be advanced from a nanoparticle-characterization tool to one that explicitly probes the short-ranged interactions of nanoparticles with soft networks, such as synthetic gels and biological tissues. In this paper, calculations are undertaken that identify a generalized Huckel limit for nanoparticles in low-conductivity gels, and a new Smoluchowski limit for polyelectrolyte-coated particles in high-conductivity gels that is independent of the gel permeability. Also of fundamental interest is a finite, albeit small, electrophoretic mobility for uncharged particles in charged gels. Electrophoretic mobilities and drag coefficients (with electroviscous effects) for nanoparticles bearing non-uniform coronas show that relaxation effects are typically weak for the small nanoparticles (radius approximate to 3-10 nm) to which gel-electrophoresis has customarily been applied, but are profound for the larger nanoparticles (radius greater than or similar to 40 nm in low conductivity gels) to which passivated gel-electrophoresis experiments have recently been applied. To demonstrate its practical application, the model is applied to (pH charge regulating) carboxylated polystyrene nanospheres in low-density passivated agarose gels (weak steric effects).

Here, in agreement with previous results, we found that the time needed to turn a dry grain into a dilute solution is not limited by water diffusion in the glassy or semi-crystalline dry polymer, but rather by the life-time of the transient gel made of entangled chains. In addition, we shed new light on the dissolution process by demonstrating that, in contrast to theoretical predictions, the gel life-time is not governed by reptation. We show instead that swelling is simply controlled by the osmotic pressure and the gel permeability until the overlap concentration is reached within the gel. At this stage, the gel turns into a dilute solution in which polymers are dispersed by natural convection. The observed dependence of the dissolution process on the molar mass therefore originates from the molar mass dependent overlap concentration. Under stirring, or forced convection, the polymer gel disappears at a higher critical concentration that depends on the shear rate. We suggest a description of the experimental data which uses the rheological flow curves of the solutions of the considered polymer. Inversely, dissolution times of polymer powders under stirring can be inferred from classical rheological measurements of the polymer solutions at varied concentrations.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Chiral templating of alumina nanofilms by the atomic layer deposition process", "Abstract": "In this communication, we describe the synthesis of new chiral alumina nanofilms and surfaces.

The next stage of this technological revolution will be the development of active, controllable, and non-linear metamaterials, surpassing natural media as platforms for optical data processing and quantum information applications. However, scientists are constantly faced with the need to find new methods that can ensure the formation of quantum and non-linear metamaterials with higher resolution. One such method of producing metamaterials in the future, which will provide scalability and availability, is chemical synthesis. Meanwhile, the chemical synthesis of organized 3D structures with a period of a few nanometers and a size of up to a few millimeters is not an easy task and is yet to be resolved. The most promising avenue seems to be the use of highly porous structures based on metalorganic frameworks that have demonstrated their unique properties in the field of non-linear optics ( NLO) over the past three years. Thus, the aim of this review is to examine current progress and the possibilities of using metal-organic frameworks in the field of non-linear optics as chemically obtained metamaterials of the future. The review begins by presenting the theoretical principles of physical phenomena represented by mathematical descriptions for clarity. Major attention is paid to the second harmonic generation ( SHG) effect. In this section we compare inorganic single crystals, which are most commonly used to study the effect in question, to organic materials, which also possess the required properties. Based on these data, we present a rationale for the possibility of studying the non-linear optical properties of metal-organic structures as well as describing the use of synthetic approaches and the difficulties associated with them. The second part of the review explicitly acquaints the reader with a new class of materials which successfully combines the positive properties of organic and inorganic materials. Using recently synthesized metalorganic frameworks and coordination polymers in the field of non-linear optics as an example, we consider synthetic approaches used for obtaining materials with desired properties and the factors to be considered in this case.

Here, we report a redox-active xerogel composed of 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMQ) decorated on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets via a hydrothermal method as a high capacitance and long cycle life pseudocapacitive electrode. DMQ not only provided stable redox-active centers but also served as a spacer to avoid rGO sheets aggregation and led to a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical electrode architecture. When a binder-free 50 mu m thick rolled film was tested as a pseudocapacitive electrode, it exhibited an excellent capacitance of 650 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) (780 F cm(-3)) in 1 M sulfuric acid, outperforming a large number of reported organic and inorganic electrodes. Most importantly, optimized electrodes showed an excellent capacitance retention of 99% after 25000 cycles at 50 mV s(-1).

In this work, we report a conceptual strategy in a ternary material system to simultaneously enhance the charge separation and water oxidation efficiency of photoanodes by introducing reduced graphite oxide (rGO) and NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) on TiO2 nanorod arrays (NAs). An experimental-computational combination study reveals that rGO with a high work function and superior electron mobility accepts photogenerated electrons from TiO2 and enables fast electron transportation; while NiFe-LDH acts as a cocatalyst which accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction. This synergistic effect in this ternary TiO2/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode gives rise to a largely enhanced photoconversion efficiency (0.58% at 0.13 V) and photocurrent density (1.74 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V). It is worth mentioning that the photocurrent density of TiO2/rGO/NiFe-LDH, to the best of our knowledge, is superior to previously reported TiO2-based photoanodes in benign and neutral media.

In this way, Ni cermet anode conductivity is not influenced, and cell cracking due to the thermal-mechanical stress from the mismatched thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) between the catalyst and anode materials, the temperature gradients within the anode caused by the highly endothermic reforming reaction of methane, and the large internal strain during the reduction process is also avoided. La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF), which is co-pressed with an Al2O3 substrate into a double-layered slice with a mesoporous structure, functions as an independent catalyst layer of the Ni-based anode.

By controlling electrospinning conditions carefully, the incorporated zeolites in EVOH were found to correspond closely to the feed ratios. Elemental mapping images of Si show that zeolites were uniformly blended within the fibers. The fabricated composite fibers successfully adsorbed creatinine from solution and the adsorption capacity reached a maximum at 12 h. The crystallinity of the nanofiber was also controlled by varying the composition of ethylene content in EVOH. Less crystallinity resulted in higher creatinine adsorption capacity due to the barrier property of EVOH. Cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the composite fibers showed less toxicity than free zeolite particles which killed more than 95% of cells. The proposed composite fibers, therefore, have the potential to be utilized as a new approach to removing creatinine selectively from the bloodstream.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Effective Utilization of the Electrostatic Repulsion for Improved Alignment of Electrospun Nanofibers", "Abstract": "Uniaxial alignment of electrospun fibers can provide a useful approach to develop novel functional nanomaterials for applications in a wide variety of fields.

To estimate a quantitative effect of PANI, we used the real contents of the PANI-DBSA component/phase determined from the PANI polymerization yield. The highest magnitudes and rates of the sensor responses to gaseous ammonia are shown by the nanocomposite layer with an intermediate PANI-DBSA content (18.9 wt%) and cast from the nanocomposite dispersion in CB.

In this paper, to overcome these limitations, the active lactone form of CPT-soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) complex self-assembled nanoparticles (CPT-SPC NPs) is prepared by a co-solvent method combined with a self-assembly technique. The CPT-SPC complex is characterized by solubility, UV-vis, H-1 NMR, FTIR, XRD, and fluorescence analysis. These results prove the efficient complexation between active lactone form of CPT and SPC (complexation rate was high as approximately 98%). The self-assembled CPT-SPC NPs show a hydrodynamic particle size of 210.7 +/- 6.1 nm, a zeta potential of -24.9 +/- 3.1 mV, a spherical shape, and a high drug-loading content of 16.3 +/- 0.5%. CPT is released from the CPT-SPC NPs in a biphasic way with an initial burst release followed by a subsequent sustained release. Additionally, in comparision with the free CPT, the CPT-SPC NPs, because of the improved drug stability and enhanced drug transport across cellular membranes, present significantly higher cellular uptake efficiency and cell-killing effect of the drug. Moreover, both confocal imaging and fluorescence measurements demonstrate that CPT is able to be delivered to nuclei by the CPT-SPC NPs after their cellular uptake, by real-time monitoring of drug release and intracellular drug delivery.

In this study, Ag nanoparticle and graphene co-loaded TiO2 with various contents of Ag and graphene was prepared via a facile surfactant free solvothermal method in a mixture of water and ethanol solvents and was applied, for the first time, for the photocatalytic degradation of paraoxon (as a model organophosphorus compound) under visible light irradiation. In this ternary nanocomposite, the presence of Ag nanoparticles is for narrowing the band gap to the visible region due to its surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and the presence of graphene is for diminishing the recombination rate of the photogenerated electron and holes due to its high electrical conductivity. The results of photocatalytic activity tests demonstrate that the nanocomposite with 6% wt Ag and 1% wt graphene content has the best photocatalytic activity among the products. Investigation of the chemical state of the nanocomposites showed that the covering of Ag nanoparticle loaded TiO2 with a high weight ratio of graphene resulted in the formation of Ag-O bonds through bonding of Ag to the oxygen functional groups of graphene which causes a decrease of the SPR effect of Ag and by this way decreases the photocatalytic activity.

The crystal structure, morphology, and specific surface area were thoroughly characterized. It is found that the Pt-SnO2 nanocomposites consist of a large amount of small spheres with average diameters up to hundreds of nanometers, and every small sphere is composed of numerous primary nanocrystallites with an average size of about 8 nm. Compared with the pristine SnO2, the presence of Pt nanoparticles has no influence on the growth behavior of the SnO2 microspheres. The gas sensors based SnO2 microspheres in a composite with Pt nanoparticles not only show a lower operating temperature and immensely enhanced responses, but also exhibit a faster response and recovery speeds and remarkable stability to methanol, especially the 5.0 mol% Pt-SnO2 nanocomposite. The gas sensor based on the 5.0 mol% Pt-SnO2 nanocomposite exhibits a response value of 190.88 to 100 ppm methanol at a low operating temperature of 80 degrees C, while the gas sensor based on pristine SnO2 only displayed a response value of 19.38 at an operating temperature of 200 degrees C. The reasonable explanation of the gas-sensing performance enhancement for the gas sensors based on Pt-SnO2 nanocomposites is attributed to the strong spillover effect of the Pt nanoparticles and the electronic interaction between Pt nanoparticles and SnO2 microspheres, both of which promoted the low temperature gas-sensing performance.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "A polysulfobetaine hydrogel for immobilization of a glucose-binding protein", "Abstract": "A hydrogel based on sulfobetaine methacrylate monomer N-(methacryloyloxyethyl)-N, N-dimethyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine and N, N-bis(methacryloyloxyethyl)-N-methyl-N-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine used as a crosslinker was investigated as a potential material for biosensor applications.

As model membranes, large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) have been prepared using an extrusion method and their size distribution confirmed using dynamic light scattering. The zeta potential of LUV in the presence of different sodium salts has been estimated from the measured electrophoretic mobility. The intrinsic binding constant of Na+ in the presence of various counterions, such as Cl-, Br-, and I- was derived from the zeta potential using Gouy-Chapman theory at moderate salt concentrations (10-100 mM). The apparent binding constant estimated from ITC is in agreement with that obtained from the zeta potential. The overall endothermic response of binding heat suggests that the ion-membrane interaction is primarily entropy driven. The entropy gain might arise due to release of water molecules from the hydration layer vicinity of the membranes. The effect of counterions on the binding affinity of Na+ follows the order I- > Br- > Cl- for neutral DOPC membranes. However, for negatively charged membranes, the order is Br- > I- > Cl-. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy also compliment the zeta potential and ITC results. Fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy experiments suggest that among all anions I- adsorbs and penetrates into the membrane, indicating a significant effect of the I- ion compared to other anions.

Three different types of electrospinning (single fluid, traditional coaxial and a modified coaxial process) were employed to manipulate the distribution of Eu(TTA)(3)phen in PAN nanofibers, producing systems with a uniform distribution of complex throughout the entire fibers or where it was localized only in the core or sheath of the fibers. TEM confirmed that the fibers produced had the expected nanoscale architectures and that the Eu(TTA)(3)phen was distributed as desired in the PAN nanofibers through the selective application of different types of electrospinning processes. SEM and fluorescent tests proved that PAN nanofibers from the modified coaxial process had smooth surfaces, the narrowest diameters and the strongest fluorescent intensity. In the modified coaxial process, the sheath flow rate can be exploited to control the nanofibers' diameters; a sheath-to-core flow rate ratio of 0.1 and 0.2 gave PAN nanofibers with diameters of 380 +/- 110 nm and 230 +/- 70 nm, respectively. Modified coaxial electrospinning using a Eu(TTA)(3)phen solution as a sheath fluid not only facilitates a smooth process providing nanofibers with reduced diameters, but also allows functionalization of the nanofibers through coating with functional components effectively, ensuring that the active Eu(TTA)(3)phen is on the surface and leading to enhanced activity.

Extraction of specific bioactive glycoproteins from physiological fluids is highly required for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Concanavalin A (Con A) is a tetramer lectin protein that can specifically bind glycospecies containing sugar units, and this binding occurs in physiological environments. Inspired by this, we propose a sugar-lectin recognition based glycoprotein surface imprint, which is anticipated to selectively extract bioactive glycoproteins in physiological environments. The glycosylated biomarker, transferrin, was used as a model template. Transferrin was first immobilized on a Con A modified Fe3O4 surface via the sugar-lectin interaction at pH 7.4. Dopamine was then polymerized onto this surface for glycoprotein imprinting at the same pH, and continuous oxygen bubbling into the dopamine solution improved the polymerization speed. After removal of the template by boronate buffer, transferrin imprinted Fe3O4 was obtained. The subsequent binding experiment indicated that the transferrin imprint has pH dependent binding affinity towards this protein. The optimal transferrin binding capacity, as well as the maximum imprinting factor was observed at neutral pH. The isotherm adsorption study reveals that imprinted and non-imprinted material are both fitted with the Langmuir adsorption model. Single selective adsorption and competitive adsorption experiments show that the obtained surface imprint has selectivity towards template glycoprotein, and circular dichroism (CD) spectral analysis indicates that boronate buffer washing has no negative influence on the natural structure of transferrin and Con A.

Compared to the neat gels, W-C gels exhibit improved properties, which are directly dependent on the content of both the CNW and CMCS. For W-C gels, an increase in the CNW has an obvious reinforcement effect, which could be strengthened further by an increased CMCS content, due to the strong interaction between these components. Better compression resistance and elasticity is also observed as the CNW and CMCS content increases. Moreover, the W-C gels retain good swelling capacity with obvious responsiveness to both pH and temperature, which is similar to that of neat gels; the ionization of CMCS increases the swelling ratio of gels in both acidic and alkaline conditions, except in a certain pH region (pH = 4-6), corresponding to the correlative isoelectric points (IEP) of CMCS with PDMAEMA, where a low swelling ratio is found.

In this article, we present a class of photo-sensitizers constituted by heteroleptic bis-diimine copper(I) complexes, whose features rely on their tunable MLCT excited states and earth abundant and environmentally friendly nature of copper. These properties make this class of dyes compatible with a sustainable development. Their synthesis through the HETPHEN strategy and the background of their photophysical properties as well as the recent advances in the fields of both dye-sensitized solar cells and photoinduced charge separation are presented. The presented examples prove that bis-diimine copper(I) complexes are valuable dyes to be used to build multicomponent arrays for long range electron transfer and for dye-sensitized solar cells. These examples illustrate that one major advantage of heteroleptic complexes is the possibility to finely tune their opto-electronic properties to a larger extent than homoleptic complexes.

The bio-fuels derived from lignocellulosic biomass are popularly referred to as second-generation bio-fuels. To date, several thermochemical conversion pathways for the production of second-generation bio-fuels have shown commercial promise; however, most of these remain at various pre-commercial stages. In view of their imminent commercialization, it is important to conduct a profound and comprehensive comparison of these production techniques. Accordingly, the scope of this review is to fill this essential knowledge gap by mapping the entire value chain of second-generation bio-fuels from technical, economic, and environmental perspectives. This value chain covers (i) the thermochemical technologies used to convert solid biomass feedstock into easier-to-handle intermediates, such as bio-oil, syngas, methanol, and Fischer-Tropsch fuel; and (ii) the upgrading technologies used to convert intermediates into end products, including diesel, gasoline, renewable jet fuels, hydrogen, char, olefins, and oxygenated compounds. This review also provides an economic and commercial assessment of these technologies, with the aim of identifying the most adaptable technology for the production of bio-fuels, fuel additives, and bio-chemicals. A detailed mapping of the carbon footprints of the various thermochemical routes to second-generation bio-fuels is also carried out. The review concludes by identifying key challenges and future trends for second-generation petroleum substitute bio-fuels.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Porous carbon derived from rice husks as sustainable bioresources: insights into the role of micro-/mesoporous hierarchy in hosting active species for lithium-sulphur batteries", "Abstract": "The exploration of natural resources as sustainable precursors affords a family of green materials. Exploring highly abundant and available biowaste precursors remaining from food processing throughout a scalable and cost-effective material synthesis path is highly important especially for new materials discovery in emerging energy storage technologies such as lithium-sulphur (Li-S) batteries. Herein, we have produced a series of carbon materials with hierarchical micro-/mesopores from a very cheap and abundant lignocellulosic bio-waste, namely rice husk. The carbonisation of the lignocellulosic fraction leads to the formation of micropores while the removal of the silica present naturally in the rice husk composition allows the formation of mesopores. We can easily tune the ratio of micropores to mesopores by simply tuning the synthesis conditions in order to achieve an optimal performance in Li-S batteries after sulphur infiltration into the resulting porous carbons. Our optimal cathode scaffold for Li-S batteries exhibited a high capacity of 1032 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 C. An ultralow decay rate of 0.055% per cycle was achieved. The appearance of abundant micropores with a higher surface area renders a high initial capacity of sulphur to polysulphides; however, the sufficient mesopore volume is more vital for a lower cyclic decay, which is prerequisite for the generation of solid products and smooth ion diffusion. This work, besides reporting on an efficient method to produce efficient electrode materials from waste to be used in energy storage technologies also provides fresh insights into the required structural features to allow effective cathode materials for high-performance Li-S batteries.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Autohydrolysis pretreatment of softwood - enhancement by phenolic additives and the effects of other compounds", "Abstract": "The effects of different additives on lignin repolymerisation in the autohydrolysis pretreatment of soft-wood and the consequences for enzymatic cellulose digestibility have been studied. The study comprised 35 substances including alcohols, amines, heterocyclic and other compounds. It has been shown that lignin repolymerisation does not only hinder hydrolysis by the deactivation of cellulases, but can also obstruct their access to cellulose. A new class of phenolic additives has been discovered that can block lignin repolymerisation and thus increase glucose yields in hydrolysis by more than 40%. Dimethylphloroglucinol was found to be even more effective than 2-naphthol, the most effective lignin repolymerisation blocker reported to date. The study reveals that effective additives have to be highly nucleophilic and must not act as a crossing agent for lignin fragments, which can dramatically worsen glucose yields. Phenolic compounds activated by several hydroxy groups with only a single reactive aromatic site are however very beneficial in enhancing pretreatment. The order of effectiveness of the tested compounds is consistent with the hypothesis that they compete with the aromatic rings present in lignin for lignin carbocations. These ions have been proposed earlier to be intermediates in the formation of repolymerised lignin structures. While compounds activated towards electrophilic substitution generally had a high impact, compounds that can stop radical repolymerisation had no effect. The gained insights open up the possibility to identify numerous further additives that can enhance autohydrolysis, steam and acidic pretreatments of lignocellulose.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Fueling biomass-degrading oxidative enzymes by light-driven water oxidation", "Abstract": "Photosynthesis may be described as light-driven oxidation of water and subsequent use of the generated reducing equivalents to fix CO2 and synthesize higher energy organic compounds, such as carbohydrates. The transposition of the sustainable and atom-efficient strategy of water oxidation to in vitro controlled biocatalytic reactions is poorly studied but is of high interest for the development of photobiocatalysis, and eco-friendly catalytic tools in a wider sense. Here we demonstrate that light-driven oxidation of water catalysed by vanadium-doped TiO2 (V-TiO2), a re-usable photocatalyst, can provide the electrons that lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) need to oxidatively deconstruct biomass polysaccharides. The demonstration that electrons may be generated by water oxidation alleviates the need for an externally added electron donor, which so far has been a prerequisite for LPMO activity. Importantly, photocatalytic LPMO activation was achieved in the absence of redox mediators, which represents the first demonstration of mediator-free electron transfer from V-TiO2 particles to a redox enzyme, expanding the repertoire of known and conceivable photobiocatalytic reactions. Fundamentally, this photobiocatalytic system allows activation and tight control of LPMO activity, thus offering new tools for mechanistic studies of these industrially important and ubiquitous enzymes. The latter is illustrated by real-time studies of the redox state of an LPMO, using the controllable light-V-TiO2 technology for LPMO reduction and a novel fluorescence method for monitoring re-oxidation. We also show that the light-V-TiO2 technology may be used to study pre-activation of LPMOs.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Enzyme free detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) using ferrocene carboxylic acid labeled monoclonal antibodies: an electrochemical approach", "Abstract": "Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of the most potent toxin threats in bioterrorism and can be produced as an offensive biological warfare (BW) agent (Type B).

In addition, we demonstrated MFCSPPA mediated singlet oxygen production in solution conditions by using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as a fluorescence detector. Moreover, the in vitro PDT activities against human HeLa cervical cancer cells were investigated by MTT assay. The phototoxicity experiments showed that MFCSPPA has strong photodynamic therapy activity and low dark toxicity, and the cancer cell viability was reduced to 18% after treatment with PDT. Phagocytosis of MFCSPPA experiments indicated that it could be successfully taken up to some extent by HeLa cells with a suitable lipo-hydro partition coefficient and biocompatibility. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double fluorescence staining suggested that the cells are all in a state of apoptosis or necrosis after PDT treatment for 6 h. In addition, we studied the formation of reactive oxygen species in HeLa cells after MFCSPPA-PDT treatment; the results suggested that type I and type II photodynamic reactions can occur simultaneously, yet type I photodynamic reactions have a slight edge over type II.

The catalysts with different structures and morphologies were obtained by changing the synthesis conditions such as pH value, reaction time, temperature and S/Mo molar ratio and their activities were tested in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of p-cresol. The results showed that the structure of MoS2 and its catalytic activity were mainly influenced by the pH value in the synthesis procedure. The surface area decreased with the reduction of pH value. MoS2 possessed a sheet-like shape when the pH was adjusted to an appropriate value. The catalyst synthesis conditions for MoS2 had little effect on the product distribution but affected the conversion in the HDO of p-cresol. The HDO activity of MoS2 depended on the sheet-like shape and slab length. High reaction temperature was beneficial to enhance the deoxygenation degree. The prepared MoS2 had good stability during the reaction, and also presented high activity in the HDO of other phenols such as phenol, o-cresol and 4-ethylphenol.

To demonstrate this, silver-containing polymer (PMMA) fibers have been produced by electrospinning, then subjected to different levels of exposure to UV radiation and fully characterized in terms of silver state, presence of nanoparticles, Ag+ release rates and bactericidal power. The as-spun fibers contained mainly silver as Ag+, while samples exposed to UV radiation displayed progressively higher proportions of Ag-0 (XPS analysis). Nanoparticles consisting of metallic silver were present in UV-exposed samples, and their size increased with irradiation time. The Ag+ release rates (and the bactericidal action of the nanofibers) were found to directly depend on the degree of UV exposure: a fast Ag+ release was observed for non-irradiated samples, which during the release experiment delivered roughly three times as much silver than samples subjected to 24 h UV exposure.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "CdS/CdSe co-sensitized hierarchical TiO2 nanofiber/ZnO nanosheet heterojunction photoanode for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells", "Abstract": "In this manuscript, a novel hierarchical ZnO nanosheets branched electrospun TiO2 non-woven fabric film is prepared and used as a photoanode for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).

The method enables 80 wt% lignin conversion by using Ni catalyst-supported amorphous silica-alumina (ASA) at 300 degrees C in the presence of 6 MPa H-2. The crucial factors to achieve direct lignin hydrodeoxygenation are the suitable balance in solvent selection and the design of active sites in the solvent liquid phase. The activity of Ni nanoparticles in dodecane leads to higher efficiency in the deconstruction of external C-O bonds in lignin. The consumption of lignin shifts the equilibrium of lignin solubility and weakens the impact of the relatively poor lignin solubility in dodecane for lignin depolymerization. The key element in controlling the activity of Ni-based catalysts is the specific external surface areas of diverse supports as well as the sizes of metallic Ni sites. This is probably because of the high external surface areas that can provide good contact opportunities for Ni sites in the lignin macromolecule. The efficient contact of active sites in the polymer reactant is the most important factor for such solid-solid reactions. The size and distribution of active Ni sites as well as the specific surface areas of Ni/ASA as modified by the different deposition precipitation times, reduction temperatures, and Ce additives can greatly affect the ability of a metal to attack the external C-O bonds of lignin. Furthermore, the acidity of the support (especially Bronsted acid sites) as modified by the Si/Al ratio of ASA significantly enhances the capabilities and alters the electronic structures of Ni nanoparticles for cleavage of the C-O linkages of lignin. This suggests that the synergy of acid and metal sites can be subtly tailored to strengthen the catalytic performance of Ni metallic sites.

The short-chained butyl derivatives behave as classical long-chained surfactants do.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant (free radical scavenging activity, reducing power and lipid peroxidation inhibition), anti-inflammatory (inhibition of NO production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages) and cytotoxic (in a panel of human tumor cell lines and in non-tumor porcine liver primary cells) properties of O. quadripartita, providing a phytochemical characterization of its aqueous extracts and different organic fractions, by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS). Twenty-eight individual phenolic compounds were identified: fifteen flavan-3-ols, six flavones, four flavonols, two phenolic acids and one flavanone derivative. The most abundant compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction were (+)-catechin and procyanidin dimer B1 (EC-4,8-C). Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside was the major compound in both the n-butanol fraction and crude aqueous extract. In most of the samples and assays the antioxidant activity was higher than the one revealed by the positive control gallic acid, with the highest antioxidant activity observed in the ethyl acetate fraction.

Here, we explore the influences of the carbonization temperature on the microstructural and textural characteristics of the novolac-derived carbon aerogels. A high-temperature carbonization process leads to the elimination of -OH groups from the molecular structure of the novolac-derived carbon aerogels, which in turn results in a reduction of the impurity scattering rate along the carrier transport pathway. Although, the density of the novolac-derived carbon aerogels increases with carbonization temperature, the content of micropores grows at higher temperatures, as the extent of -OH groups leaving the structure of carbon aerogels in the form of volatile gases increases at the higher pyrolysis temperatures. Moreover, the size and perfection of the nanocrystallite sites increase with carbonization temperature and hence, the imperfection scattering effect reduces at higher pyrolysis temperatures. As the carrier scattering rates decrease, the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of the novolac-derived carbon aerogels enhance with the pyrolysis temperature. In addition, an analytical modified series-parallel thermal conductivity model is presented here, and this model is used successfully for predicting the thermal conductivity of carbon aerogels derived from different organic precursors, and under different service conditions. No fitting parameters are involved in this model, and the only input data needed for the prediction procedure are microstructural characteristics of the carbon aerogels.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "The novel functional nucleic acid iRed effectively regulates target genes following cytoplasmic delivery by faint electric treatment", "Abstract": "An intelligent shRNA expression device (iRed) contains the minimum essential components needed for shRNA production in cells, and could be a novel tool to regulate target genes. However, general delivery carriers consisting of cationic polymers/lipids could impede function of a newly generated shRNA via electrostatic interaction in the cytoplasm. Recently, we found that faint electric treatment (fET) of cells enhanced delivery of siRNA and functional nucleic acids into the cytoplasm in the absence of delivery carriers. Here, we examined fET of cells stably expressing luciferase in the presence of iRed encoding anti-luciferase shRNA. Transfection of lipofectamine 2000 (LFN)/iRed lipoplexes showed an RNAi effect, but fET-mediated iRed transfection did not, likely because of the endosomal localization of iRed after delivery. However, fET in the presence of lysosomotropic agent chloroquine significantly improved the RNAi effect of iRed/fET to levels that were higher than those for the LFN/iRed lipoplexes. Furthermore, the amount of lipid droplets in adipocytes significantly decreased following fET with iRed against resistin in the presence of chloroquine.

Therefore, effective thought has been put into engineering the GBs to convert ZNF into a promising photocatalyst. Herein, the obtained electrospun ZnO structures are composed of nanograins, which are connected to each other in an ordered manner. In-depth studies have revealed that the growth of nanograins severely altered the morphology of ZNF and GB areas at higher annealing temperatures ranging from 500 degrees C to 1000 degrees C.

The traditional OER catalysts, such as IrO2, RuO2 and their binary or ternary oxides, have finite large-scale commercial applications due to their significant cost and rareness. Here, we hydrothermally synthesized cry-Ir by doping Ir into non-OER active cryptomelane-type manganese oxide to significantly reduce the Ir mass ratio by 60.3% from 85.7% in IrO2 to 34% in the developed catalyst, along with higher OER performance with a lower onset potential and 10 times higher specific mass activity. The special tunnel structure of cryptomelane plays an important role in promoting its OER activity through facilitating water molecular insertion into the tunnel. We combined Raman, XPS and TEM mapping to confirm that no IrO2 composite is present on the cry-Ir surface. The XPS and XAS spectra indicate substitution of Ir4+ on the Mn3+ site and the presence of more 5d states in the Ir site compared to IrO2. The differences in VBS spectra between cry-Ir, IrO2 and cry-Mn indicate that the electronic structure of Ir sites is modified when Ir substitutes Mn3+ sites.

Nitrogen doping within a graphitic/turbostratic network of carbon atoms generates active sites for the ORR via C-N bond polarisation that induces a reduced energy barrier towards the ORR on the adjacent carbon atom. At the same time, nitrogen doping leads to an increased electrical conductivity due to electron excess in the delocalised p-system. Thus, the electrical conductivity and the number and the nature of the active sites are two important factors determining the performance of nitrogen-doped carbons in the ORR. Herein, N-doped nanocarbon/graphene composites were carefully designed, synthesized, characterized and tested as electrocatalysts in the ORR in order to decouple these two factors and investigate the underlying relationships between them. Chitosan was used as a nitrogen precursor for nanocarbon, while reduced graphene oxide was introduced to tune the electrical conductivity.

The CN had diameter of 15 nm, measured over 300 nm in length, and had high electrical stability (zeta potentials ranged from -20.8 to -24.5). Given the XRD patterns, the crystallinity index (CrI) of CN ranged from 45 to 68%, depending on the chemical pretreatment the startingmaterial was submitted to. CN obtained from SS treated with NaOH 17.5% and H2O2 (CrI = 45%) displayed better thermal stability probably because a lignin-cellulose complex emerged. The soluble fraction obtained in the first step of CN production contained a large amount of reducing sugars (11.2 to 30.4 g/100 g of SS).

Polymer nanoparticles can be rationally designed and self-assembled with control over particle size, morphology, charge and shape, allowing for optimization of drug delivery. However, post-functionalization of particles with antibodies or proteins can influence the self-assembly process and creates challenges in maintaining bioactivity. RESULTSAn EGFR-targeting scFv antibody fragment has been integrated as a hydrophilic moiety, and through self-assembly driven by a thermoresponsive polymer, formed antibody-targeted polymeric nanoparticles (immunoparticles) of approximately 320nm in diameter. The binding of the scFv to native EGFR on MDA MB 468 cells and to recombinant EGFR was determined using flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance respectively. Conjugation of the scFv to the thermoresponsive polymer did not compromise the binding to EGFR. Furthermore, cross-linking the scFv with glutaraldehyde to stabilize the immunoparticle did not impact the binding of the particle to EGFR.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that the SBR/CMC binder lowers the ohmic resistance of the electrode, depresses the formation of SEI film and, facilitates the charge transfer reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. These advantages highlight the potential applications of SBR/CMC binder in lithium ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Acrylic fibres of homopolymer PAN are subjected to thermo-oxidative treatment following a four-stage or a two-stage isothermal programme, and the resulting oxidized fibres are pyrolyzed up to 1000 A degrees C for 30 min or they are flash-pyrolyzed at 1000 A degrees C for 5 min, and the shrinkage and weight loss are determined. According to FTIR spectra, two indices were expressed to follow the dehydrogenations and cyclizations (nitrile groups) and the band intensity of carbonyl groups to follow the oxidation. The carbon fibres produced from the four-stage oxidation were examined using SEM/EDS. Based on SEM/EDS analysis, an oxygen content of approx. 8.7 at.% in the fibres is needed for the stabilization of the fibres during the oxidation by a four-stage treatment up to 300 A degrees C. These carbon fibres were electrochemically modified by Cyclic Voltammetry in narrow and wide potential regions, using aqueous H2SO4. The electrochemical treatment of carbon fibres in the wide region leads to the introduction of an additional amount of oxygen of about 5 at.%, exhibiting also acidic and basic groups in adequate amount. The formation of oxygenous groups on carbon fibres during the three processes is indirectly followed by their ability to adsorb methylene blue or alizarin yellow dyes, based on the concept of \"acid-base interaction\".

Both kinetic and isotherm data were obtained. The kinetic and isotherm data fitted very well with the pseudo second-order kinetic model and Freundlich isotherm model, respectively. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous, favorable, and exothermic. The pH of dye solution and electrostatic interaction do not play an important role on the adsorption process.

We compare two types of CdSe/ZnS QDs equipped with different organic coatings, namely dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA)-capped QDs and phospholipid micelle-encapsulated QDs. Both QD types have their PL intensity quenched at acidic pH values, but they differ in terms of the reversibility of the quenching process. For DHLA-capped QDs, the quenching is nearly irreversible, with a small reversible component visible only on short time scales. For phospholipid micelle-encapsulated QDs the quenching is notably almost fully reversible. We suggest that the surface passivation by the organic ligands is reversible for the micelle-encapsulated QDs. Additionally, both coatings display pH-dependent spectral shifts. These shifts can be explained by a combination of irreversible processes, such as photo-oxidation and acid etching, and reversible charging of the QD surface, leading to the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE), the extent of each effect being coating-dependent.

The fluorescence quenching by PA can be attributed to the fact that both photoinduced electron transfer and energy transfer are involved in the quenching process. In addition, pyrene monomer fluorescence is also quenched and exhibits different trends for different explosives. Fluorescence lifetime studies have revealed a dominant static quenching mechanism of the current fluorescent sensors for explosives in aqueous solution. Selectivity study demonstrates that common interferents have an insignificant effect on the emission intensity of the fluorescent nanofibers in aqueous phase, while reusability study indicates that the fluorescent nanofibers can be regenerated.

This phenomenon opens up many potential biomedical applications for drug delivery. The morphology and structure of both dry and wet fibers were characterized in detail. The hordein/zein fibers fabricated at relatively lower voltage were stabilized by the preaggregated nanoscale hydrophobic domains and exhibited restricted swelling while maintaining a flat sheet shape With minimal changes to secondary structure when immersed in water. By applying a higher voltage, we triggered a greater bending instability during, the electrospinning process, and the hordein/zein network structure generated could rapidly relax in an aqueous environment. This increased mobility of molecular Chains allowed the uneven aggregation Of hydrophobic dopants, which catalyzed the self-rolling of the aligned fibers. Sessile drop measurements even showed a reduction in the contact angle from 106 to 39 degrees for the fibers with 50% zein prepared at raised voltage, indicating the conversion, of surface properties caused by the relaxation. All the fibers demonstrated low toxicity in human primary dermal fibroblast cell culture.

The potential reproduces both the measured methane isotherm for HKUST-1 and the site preference for adsorption at CUS. Extension to 17 metal-substituted variants confirms that CUS composition can dramatically alter uptake, with Ni- and Ca-based compounds predicted to exceed the performance of Cu-HKUST-1.

Herein, we report on an efficient chemical self-doping to increase the conductivity through one-dimensional stacking arrangement of electron donor acceptor (D-A) molecules. The D-A molecule employed was a 1-methylpiperidine substituted perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (MP-PTCDI), of which the methylpiperidine moiety is a strong electron donor, and can form a charge transfer complex with PTCDI (acting as the acceptor), generating anionic radical of PTCDI as evidenced in molecular solutions. Upon self-assembling into nanoribbons through columnar pi-pi stacking, the intermolecular charge transfer interaction between methylpiperidine and PTCDI would be enhanced, and the electrons generated are delocalized along the pi-pi stacking of PTCDIs, leading to enhancement in conductivity. The conductive fiber materials thus produced can potentially be used as chemiresistive sensor for vapor detection of electron deficient chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, taking advantage of the large surface area of nanofibers.

Because adsorption is the first step for all other processes (protection against degradation and polymerization), it is important that it is performed under conditions that existed on prebiotic Earth. In this paper, we use an artificial seawater (seawater 4.0 Ga), which contains major cations and anions that could present on the oceans of the prebiotic Earth. In addition, zeolites, with substituted Fe in the framework, and adenine were probably common substances on the prebiotic Earth. Thus, study the interaction between them is an important issue in prebiotic chemistry. There are two main findings described in this paper. Firstly, zeolites with different Si/Fe ratios adsorbed adenine differently. Secondly, XAFS showed that, after treatments with seawater 4.0 Ga and adenine, an increase in the complexity of the system occurred. In general, salts of seawater 4.0 Ga did not affect the adsorption of adenine onto zeolites and adenine adsorbed less onto zeolites with iron isomorphically substituted. The C=C and NH2 groups of adenine interacted with the zeolites. Gypsum, formed from aqueous species dissolved in seawater 4.0 Ga, precipitated onto zeolites. EPR spectra of zeolites showed lines caused by Fe framework and Fe3+ species. TG curves of zeolites showed events caused by loss of water weakly bound to zeolite (in the 30-140 degrees C range), water bounded to iron species or cations from seawater 4.0 Ga or located in the cavities of zeolites (157-268 degrees C) and degradation of adenine adsorbed onto zeolites (360-600 degrees C). Mass loss follows almost the same order as the amount of adenine adsorbed onto zeolites. The XAFS spectrum showed that Fe3+ could be substituted into the framework of the Fe-7-ZSM-5 zeolite.

We propose a simple model for the diffusion of charged nanoparticles in cross-linked, charged hydrogels based on a cubic periodic environment and an electrostatic interaction potential of varying range and strength, encompassing attractive and repulsive scenarios. The long-time diffusive properties are investigated by use of Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical methods. A number of experimentally observed phenomena attributed to nonsteric interactions between hydrogel polymers and diffusing particle are naturally reproduced by our model. Charged particles diffuse slower than uncharged particles, regardless of the sign of the surface charge, but with a stronger hindrance effect for attractive electrostatic interactions. This is explained in terms of charged particles sticking to the polymer network in regions of strong opposite charge and their exclusion from similarly charged regions. In the case of attractive interactions between hydrogel polymers and the diffusing particle, smaller charged particles diffuse slower than larger ones. This stands in contrast to a size filtering scenario but is in agreement with experimental findings. In the case of repulsive interactions, a range of differently sized particles diffuse equally fast.

These devices are already employed in heavy electric vehicles and electronic devices, and can complement batteries in a more sustainable future. Their widespread application could be facilitated by the development of devices that can store more energy, without compromising their fast charging and discharging times. In situ characterization methods and computational modeling techniques have recently been developed to study the molecular mechanisms of charge storage, with the hope that better devices can be rationally designed. In this Perspective, we bring together recent findings from a range of experimental and computational studies to give a detailed picture of the charging mechanisms of supercapacitors. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that the electrode pores contain a considerable number of ions in the absence of an applied charging potential. Experiments and computer simulations have shown that different charging mechanisms can then operate when a potential is applied, going beyond the traditional view of charging by counter-ion adsorption. It is shown that charging almost always involves ion exchange (swapping of co-ions for counter-ions), and rarely occurs by counter-ion adsorption alone. We introduce a charging mechanism parameter that quantifies the mechanism and allows comparisons between different systems. The mechanism is found to depend strongly on the polarization of the electrode, and the choice of the electrolyte and electrode materials. In light of these advances we identify new directions for supercapacitor research. Further experimental and computational work is needed to explain the factors that control supercapacitor charging mechanisms, and to establish the links between mechanisms and performance.

The contents of the CPs in the composite films are readily controlled by varying the electropolymerization time.

Although fiber-reinforced polymer composites show many advantages compared to other materials, delamination between reinforcing plies remains a major problem limiting further breakthrough. Traditional solutions that have been proposed to toughen the interlaminar region between reinforcing plies have already reached their limit or have important disadvantages such as a high cost or the need for adapted production processes. Recently, electrospun nanofibers have been suggested as a more viable interlaminar toughening method. Although the expected benefits are numerous, the research on composite laminates enhanced with electrospun nanofibrous veils is still very limited. The work that has been done so far is almost exclusively focused on interlaminar fracture toughness tests with different kinds of nanofibers, where typically a trial and error approach has been used. A thorough understanding of the micromechanical fracture mechanisms and the parameters to obtain toughened composites has not been reported as of yet, but it is crucial to advance the research and design highly damage-resistant composites. This article provides such insight by analyzing the nanofiber toughening effect on three different levels for several nanofiber types. Only by combining the results from different levels, a thorough understanding can be obtained. These levels correspond to the hierarchical nature of a composite: the laminate, the interlaminar region, and the matrix resin. It is found that each level corresponds to certain mechanisms that result in a toughening effect. The bridging of microcracks by electrospun nanofibers is the main toughening mechanism resulting in damage resistance. Nevertheless, the way in which the nanofiber bridging mechanism expresses itself is different for each scale and dependent on parameters linked to a certain scale. The multiscale analysis of the toughening mechanisms reported in this paper is therefore crucial for understanding the behavior of nanofiber toughened composites, and as such allows for designing novel, damage-resistant, nanofiber-toughened materials.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Scalable Fabrication of Electrospun Nanofibrous Membranes Functionalized with Citric Acid for High-Performance Protein Adsorption", "Abstract": "Fabricating protein adsorbents with high adsorption capacity and appreciable throughput is extremely important and highly desired for. the separation and purification of protein products in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries, yet still remains a great challenge.

To translate this synergistic therapy into in vivo anticancer therapy and clinical practice, we designed a novel pH-sensitive charge conversion nanocarrier (M-HHG(2)C(18)-L) that contained erlotinib/DOX combination and produced a sequential staggered drug release for synergistic lung cancer therapy. In this study, a synthetic zwitterionic oligopeptide lipid (1,5-dioctadecyl-L-glutamyl2-histidyl-hexahydrobenzoic acid, HHG(2)C(18)) was used to construct a pH-sensitive lipid bilayer (HHG(2)C(18)-L), which was subsequently applied to coat amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-NH2).

We confirmed that M-HHG(2)C(18)-L(E + D) were able to reverse surface zeta potential from negative to positive at tumor extracellular pH, thus facilitating the targeted cancer cell internalization. Furthermore, as erlotinib was sequestered in the exterior lipid bilayer and the controlled release ability of MSN-NH2, erlotinib released faster than DOX during the cellular transport. Additionally, HHG(2)C(18)-L became more positive at tumor intracellular pH and enhanced Coulombic repulsion with MSN-NH2, leading to increased sequential staggered release of erlotinib and DOX. Due to the pretreatment and time-staggered inhibition of EGFR with erlotinib and the enhanced intracellular release of DOX to the nucleus, the maximized synergistic cell killing effect was achieved.

Hence, for the molecular level elucidation of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, it is important to understand the effect of TMAO at the endothelial cell membrane-blood interface (artery wall). Heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) study of a zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid monolayer water interface (mimic of endothelial membrane-blood interface) shows that the interfacial water becomes increasingly H-up oriented in the presence of TMAO in the aqueous phase, revealing a dramatic change in the interfacial electrostatics. Examinations of charged lipid interfaces show that TMAO screens anionic phosphate less effectively than cationic choline, which confirms that TMAO increases the relative influence of the anionic phosphate by preferential screening of the cationic choline at the zwitterionic PC lipid interface where the phosphate and choline groups are simultaneously present.

These composite beads significantly improved the electrochemical properties, with specific capacitances up to 669 Fig and good cyclic stability.

In this study, we synthesized the rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based biosensor that enables detection of pathogen DNA in two analytical modes. Only in the presence of the target DNA, the template DNA can be continuously polymerized by simply carrying out RCA, which gives rise to a change of surface structure of Au electrodes and the gap between the electrodes. Electrical signal was generated after introducing hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl4) to the DNA-coated biosensor for the improvement of the conductivity of DNA, which indicates that the presence of the pathogen DNA can be detected in an electrical approach. Furthermore, the existence of the target DNA was readily detected by the naked eyes through change in colors of the electrodes from bright yellow to orange-red after RCA reaction.

It is known that the morphology of the catalyst can modulate catalytic activity and selectivity, yet this remains a relatively underexplored area in electrochemical CO2 reduction. Here, we exploit the material tunability afforded by colloidal chemistry to establish unambiguous structure/property relations between Cu nanocrystals and their behavior as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Our study reveals a non-monotonic size-dependence of the selectivity in cube-shaped copper nanocrystals. Among 24nm, 44nm and 63nm cubes tested, the cubes with 44nm edge length exhibited the highest selectivity towards CO2RR (80%) and faradaic efficiency for ethylene (41%).

For the Fe6W18@UiO-67 composite, the molecules retain their SMM properties, the energy barrier being slightly reduced in comparison to the crystalline material and the molecules exhibiting a tunneling rate of magnetization significantly faster than for Fe6W18@Gel. When Fe6W18 is introduced into MIL-101(Cr), the width of the hysteresis loops is drastically reduced and the quantum tunneling steps are smeared out because of the magnetic interactions between the antiferromagnetic matrix and the SMM guest molecules.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Equilibrium Liquid Crystal Phase Diagrams and Detection of Kinetic Arrest in Cellulose Nanocrystal Suspensions", "Abstract": "The cholesteric liquid crystal self-assembly of water-suspended cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) into a helical arrangement was observed already more than 20 years ago, and the phenomenon was used to produce iridescent solid films by evaporating the solvent or via sol-gel processing. Yet, it remains challenging to produce optically uniform films and to control the pitch reproducibly, reflecting the complexity of the three-stage drying process that is followed in preparing the films. An equilibrium liquid crystal phase formation stage is followed by a non-equilibrium kinetic arrest, which in turn is followed by structural collapse as the remaining solvent is evaporated. Here, we focus on the first of these stages, combining a set of systematic rheology and polarizing optics experiments with computer simulations to establish a detailed phase diagram of aqueous CNC suspensions with two different values of the surface charge, up to the concentration where kinetic arrest sets in. We also study the effect of varying ionic strength of the solvent. Within the cholesteric phase regime, we measure the equilibrium helical pitch as a function of the same parameters.

This paper discusses the effects of the axial magnetic field on the externally excited double single-walled carbon nanotube (DSWCNT) coupled by a Winkler elastic medium. It is assumed that both carbon nanotubes are identical and under the influence of compressive axial load with simply supported ends. Based on the Eringen nonlocal elasticity and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the system of two coupled nonhomogeneous partial differential equations of motion is derived, where the effects of the Lorentz magnetic force are obtained via a Maxwell relation. The dynamic responses of the DSWCNT system for four different cases of external transversal load are considered. The closed form solutions for the transversal displacements are obtained by applying the Bernoulli-Fourier method of particular integrals on the system of nonhomogeneous partial differential equations of motion. Also, analytical expressions of the amplitude ratio for forced vibration are derived and then validated with existing results. Moreover, the obtained analytical results for fundamental natural frequency are validated with results obtained by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and show fine agreements. The effects of compressive axial load, nonlocal parameter, axial magnetic field and stiffness coefficient of the elastic medium on the forced dynamic behavior of DSWCNT are considered through numerical examples. From numerical results we can conclude that the dynamical behavior of DSWCNT is greatly influenced by the magnetic field and nonlocal parameter. Furthermore, by selecting the intensity of the axial magnetic field in a certain range, it is possible to adjust the stiffness of the system without changing the material and geometric parameters. This effect implies a change in the natural frequencies of the system.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Photonic Crystal Flakes", "Abstract": "Photonic crystals (PCs) have been traditionally produced on rigid substrates.

A unique donor acceptor nanofibril composite comprising a compatible interface was fabricated, which is preferential for alkane adsorption. Then the enhanced adsorption disrupts the charge transfer across the interface and decreases the photocurrent, enabling the design of alkane gas sensor. We demonstrate a critical relationship between the tunable donor acceptor interface and alkane response. The composite sensor is able to provide specific distinction between different alkanes based on their kinetics of the response profiles, and outstanding general selectivity against the common polar solvents.

Further oxidation with nitric acid was also applied. The carbons were tested for ammonia sensing (45-500 ppm of NH3). Even though all samples exhibit p-type conduction, their exposure to NH3 led to different electrical outcomes. It was found that the electronic and transport properties of the carbons strongly depend on the type of nitrogen groups/surface defects, their concentration, and distribution in the carbon matrix. Pyridines and nitropyridines are the most important. A competition between the structural and chemical features of the carbons as those governing the sensing signals was observed. Exposure to ammonia altered the surface chemistry of the samples, and therefore their electrical properties. When sensitivity to H2S was tested to evaluate the selectivity of our sensors, the results showed that the chips are selective to NH3 in terms of the response time and magnitude of the signal changes.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "DFT study of conjugational electronic structures of aminoalkyl end-capped oligothiophenes up to octamers", "Abstract": "The molecular geometries and electronic properties of a series of bis(aminoalkyl) end-capped oligothiophenes (BRnTs) were investigated by means of the density functional theory (DFT). The calculations were performed on dimers up to octamers in the neutral and ionic species using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The results obtained show that the conjugated systems in the p- and n-doped oligomers had more aromaticity, with expanded and planar chains. The calculated energy gap values between the frontier molecular orbitals for the end-capped oligomers were larger than those for the unsubstituted oligomers, in which with increase in the oligomer chain length, the conduction band gap decreased. The calculated first excitation energies of BRnTs at the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level indicated that both doped oligomers (p- and n-type) had lower excitation energies than the neutral states, and that they displayed red shifts in their absorption spectra. Moreover, the results obtained for the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis showed that closing the end-side oligothiophene chains with the aminoalkyl groups eased the hole or electron transfer, owning to better charge delocalization through the backbone structures of BRnTs.

However, these composite materials usually suffer from a stacking problem during electrochemical cycling. A smart nanoarchitectural design is needed for composite materials in order to overcome this problem. Recent research on electrochemical energy storage (EES) applications has focused on the development of three-dimensional (3-D) core-shell structures. The basis for high performance electrochemical energy storage is to control the efficient intercalation of ions in such a 3-D structure.

The time-dependent controlled optimization of the core-shell nanocomposites consisting of nanoporous carbon with a thin layer of PANI nanorod arrays gives useful control over supercapacitor performance.

Revealing the catalytic mechanism of inverting family 6 glycoside hydrolases", "Abstract": "In several important classes of inverting carbohydrate-active enzymes, the identity of the catalytic base remains elusive, including in family 6 Glycoside Hydrolase (GH6) enzymes, which are key components of cellulase cocktails for cellulose depolymerization. Despite many structural and kinetic studies with both wild-type and mutant enzymes, especially on the Trichoderma reesei (Hypocrea jecorina) GH6 cellulase (TrCel6A), the catalytic base in the single displacement inverting mechanism has not been definitively identified in the GH6 family. Here, we employ transition path sampling to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism, which provides unbiased atomic-level understanding of key order parameters involved in cleaving the strong glycosidic bond. Our hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations reveal a network of hydrogen bonding that aligns two active site water molecules that play key roles in hydrolysis: one water molecule drives the reaction by nucleophilic attack on the substrate and a second shuttles a proton to the putative base (D175) via a short water wire. We also investigated the case where the putative base is mutated to an alanine, an enzyme that is experimentally still partially active. The simulations predict that proton hopping along a water wire via a Grotthuss mechanism provides a mechanism of catalytic rescue. Further simulations reveal that substrate processive motion is 'driven' by strong electrostatic interactions with the protein at the product sites and that the -1 sugar adopts a S-2(O) ring configuration as it reaches its binding site.

To increase the efficiencies of light coupling into and out of optoelectronic devices, such as thin film solar cells and flexible lighting, a substrate with high transmittance and high haze is desired. Unfortunately, optical transmittance and optical haze are usually contrasting to each other in common substrates: plastic is highly transparent but with a low optical haze, whereas paper has a high optical haze but a low total transmittance. Herein, we combine these two materials through a simple templated infiltration approach to achieve a new type of substrate, plastic-paper, which has a high optical transmittance (>85%) and high transmittance haze (>90%) in a broadband wave-length. The plastic-paper has an ultra-flat surface, is mechanically flexible, durable in different solvents and compatible with standard processing in semiconductors, which are shown by organic light emitting diodes (OLED) fabricated directly onto the plastic-paper substrate.

Two PEC systems, differentiated primarily by the extent of solar concentration (unconcentrated and 10 x concentrated) and two PV-E systems, differentiated by the degree of grid connectivity (unconnected and grid supplemented), were analyzed. In each case, a basecase system that used established designs and materials was compared to prospective systems that might be envisioned and developed in the future with the goal of achieving substantially lower overall system costs. With identical overall plant efficiencies of 9.8%, the unconcentrated PEC and non-grid connected PV-E system base-case capital expenses for the rated capacity of 3.65 kilotons H2 per year were $205 MM ($293 per m(2) of solar collection area (m(S)(-2)), $14.7 W-H2,P(-1)) and $260 MM ($371 m(S)(-2), $18.8 W-H2,P(-1)), respectively. The untaxed, plant-gate levelized costs for the hydrogen product (LCH) were $11.4 kg(-1) and $12.1 kg(-1) for the base-case PEC and PV-E systems, respectively. The 10 x concentrated PEC base-case system capital cost was $160 MM ($428 mS(-2), $11.5 W-H2,P(-1)) and for an efficiency of 20% the LCH was $9.2 kg(-1). Likewise, the grid supplemented base-case PV-E system capital cost was $66 MM ($441 m(S)(-2), $11.5 W-H2,P(-1)), and with solar-to-hydrogen and grid electrolysis system efficiencies of 9.8% and 61%, respectively, the LCH was $6.1 kg(-1). As a benchmark, a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) based grid-connected electrolysis system was analyzed. Assuming a system efficiency of 61% and a grid electricity cost of $0.07 kWh(-1), the LCH was $5.5 kg(-1). A sensitivity analysis indicated that, relative to the base-case, increases in the system efficiency could effect the greatest cost reductions for all systems, due to the areal dependencies of many of the components. The balance-of-systems (BoS) costs were the largest factor in differentiating the PEC and PV-E systems. No single or combination of technical advancements based on currently demonstrated technology can provide sufficient cost reductions to allow solar hydrogen to directly compete on a levelized cost basis with hydrogen produced from fossil energy. Specifically, a cost of CO2 greater than similar to$800 (ton CO2)(-1) was estimated to be necessary for base-case PEC hydrogen to reach price parity with hydrogen derived from steam reforming of methane priced at $12 GJ(-1) ($1.39 (kg H-2)(-1)). A comparison with low CO2 and CO2-neutral energy sources indicated that base-case PEC hydrogen is not currently cost-competitive with electrolysis using electricity supplied by nuclear power or from fossil-fuels in conjunction with carbon capture and storage. Solar electricity production and storage using either batteries or PEC hydrogen technologies are currently an order of magnitude greater in cost than electricity prices with no clear advantage to either battery or hydrogen storage as of yet. Significant advances in PEC technology performance and system cost reductions are necessary to enable cost-effective PEC-derived solar hydrogen for use in scalable grid-storage applications as well as for use as a chemical feedstock precursor to CO2-neutral high energy-density transportation fuels. Hence such applications are an opportunity for foundational research to contribute to the development of disruptive approaches to solar fuels generation systems that can offer higher performance at much lower cost than is provided by current embodiments of solar fuels generators. Efforts to directly reduce CO2 photoelectrochemically or electrochemically could potentially produce products with higher value than hydrogen, but many, as yet unmet, challenges include catalytic efficiency and selectivity, and CO2 mass transport rates and feedstock cost.

It was found that metabolically engineered E. coli with resistance at the acidic pH level in the fermentation together with reactive extraction in the purification presents the most environmentally competitive technology.

In this study, the same type of NPs was used to remove oil from oil-water mixtures (oil concentration used was 0.15 +/- 0.05 g L-1) in synthetic freshwaters and sea water in the presence and absence of low (1 ppm) and high (10 ppm) concentrations of SRFA or alginic acid. For the optimum NP concentration (17.6 ppm) and separation time (1 h), the data showed essentially 100% oil removal from synthetic freshwaters and sea water in the absence of natural organic macromolecules (NOM). Nearly 100% of C9-C20 alkanes were removed as measured by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), although removal of the longer chain alkanes was slightly lower. The presence of NOM led to a statistically significant decrease in oil removal with NOM acting as a competitive phase for either PVP or oil and reducing NP-oil interactions driven by the hydrophobic effect of PVP coating. Ionic strength facilitated oil sorption presumably by enhancing the magnetic separation of the oilNP complex or altering PVP hydrophobicity. Alteration of the separation conditions allowed optimal oil removal, with essentially 100% oil removal under most but not all conditions.

The characterization results illustrated that the electrospun nanofibers possess a feature of being bead-free, porous and having a core-shell structure, with active laccase encapsulated inside the fibers and one end of some MWCNTs inserted into the edge of the pores. After being modified by a small amount (1.5 wt%, vs. PDLLA) of MWCNTs, the specific surface area and mechanical tensile strength of MWCNTs-LCEFMs were enhanced by about 2 and 3 times compared to those of LCEFMs, respectively. The MWCNTs-LCEFMs were applied to remove the widespread phenolic organics from water, including bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan (TCS) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). Benefiting from the improved adsorption property for substrates and the promoted electron transfer in the laccase-catalytic reaction, the MWCNTs-LCEFMs showed higher activity recovery (88.9% vs. free laccase), and better storage and operational stability than LCEFMs. In addition, the adsorption efficiencies of MWCNTs-LCEFMs for BPA and 2,4-DCP were enhanced by more than 50%. The removal efficiencies of MWCNTs-LCEFMs for 2,4-DCP, BPA and TCS reached 92.6 +/- 0.74%, 95.5 +/- 0.46% and 99.7 +/- 0.02%, respectively, with the degradation efficiencies reaching 81.7 +/- 1.9%, 90.5 +/- 1.1% and 85.6 +/- 1.5%, respectively.

The removal mechanism of these phenolic pollutants by MWCNTs-LCEFMs was considered as a synergistic effect of membrane adsorption and laccase degradation, where the catalytic degradation of laccase was obviously strengthened by the improved adsorption (pre-concentration) process of the fibers and MWCNTs, and the enhanced electron transfer process of MWCNTs.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Preparation of alpha-Fe2O3/polyacrylonitrile nanofiber mat as an effective lead adsorbent", "Abstract": "alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles have been widely used in water purification because of their effective adsorption performance.

The alpha-Fe2O3/PAN nanofiber mats were prepared via electrospinning followed by a facile hydrothermal method and characterized by SEM, HRTEM, FTIR and XRD. We demonstrated that the formation mechanism of alpha-Fe2O3 anchored on the PAN nanofiber surface consists of the adsorption of iron ions on the surface of PAN, and then the nucleation and growth of alpha-Fe2O3.

It was observed that at a specific transition point, the acoustic contrast factor of vesicles changed sign from positive to negative. This change was mainly due to the change in the acoustic compressibility of the vesicles, which is inversely proportional to stiffness. The acoustic contrast temperature, corresponding to the temperature at which the acoustic contrast factor switches sign, was determined to be unique to the composition of the vesicles. This unique temperature signature allowed us to develop a separation method of vesicles with distinct membrane stiffness with target outlet purities exceeding 95%.

This paper demonstrates a new, low-volume microfluidic system that automates droplet generation, sorting, and sequential trapping in designated locations to enable the rapid assembly of arrays of DIBs. The channel layout of the device is guided by an equivalent circuit model, which predicts that a serial arrangement of hydrodynamic DIB traps enables sequential droplet placement and minimizes the hydrodynamic pressure developed across filled traps to prevent squeeze-through of trapped droplets. Furthermore, the incorporation of thin-film electrodes fabricated via evaporation metal deposition onto the glass substrate beneath the channels allows for the first time in situ, simultaneous electrical interrogation of multiple DIBs within a sealed device. Combining electrical measurements with imaging enables measurements of membrane capacitance and resistance and bilayer area, and our data show that DIBs formed in different trap locations within the device exhibit similar sizes and transport properties. Simultaneous, single channel recordings of ion channel gating in multiple membranes are obtained when alamethicin peptides are incorporated into the captured droplets, qualifying the thin-film electrodes as a means for measuring stimuli-responsive functions of membrane-bound biomolecules.

Here, we report an ultra-low-cost yet highly efficient portable device for energy conversion, by exploiting the capillary flow of an electrolyte on a filter paper matrix in which a naturally deposited gradient of reduced graphene oxide is induced through chemical synthesis. In addition, the fibres and pores present in the paper offer a criss-cross network, acting as a natural splitter of a continuous flow into tiny droplets. Our methodology thus obviates the need for any elaborate procedure for pre-generation of droplets. Further, we fabricate the necessary electrodes on filter paper by simply scribing pencil tips on the same filter paper, which facilitates the necessary electrochemical reactions. Effectively, at the anode, electrons are released, which travel through the outer circuit for cation reduction at the cathode and deliver an electrical output (voltage/current), realizing the conversion of the chemical form of energy to the electrical form in the filter paper.

Electrochemical machining (ECM) is commonly used in the deburring of internal cross holes because of its high efficiency and lack of surface residual stresses. However, in the electrochemical deburring process, stray corrosion may cause loss of machining precision and surface quality. We herein propose a localized electrochemical deburring process using a gelatinous electrolyte to solve the problem of stray corrosion. As the gelatinous electrolyte is in contact with the burr surface without macroscopic liquid flow, electrochemical corrosion is confined to the narrow bounds of the burr.

Also presented was a theoretical analysis of epitaxial mechanism of nucleation and growth of semiconducting conjugated polymers notably, P3HT on CNTs. In the present study, we elucidate the impact of molecular weight of P3HT on structural morphology and photophysical properties. The change in average molecular weight of P3HT from similar to 14 to similar to 60 kDa resulted in several structural changes, even though the mechanism of nucleation and growth continued to be epitaxial process. In the case of high-molecular weight P3HT, the crystallized fibrils were similar to 200-400 nm in length and similar to 2-3-nm thick. In contrast, for the low molecular weight, the fibrils were significantly longer (> 5 mu m) in length and similar to 800-1000-nm thick, which are envisaged to involve chain folding in relation to shorter fibrils. Furthermore, the graft density of fibrils crystallized on CNTs was remarkably higher for the high-molecular weight P3HT such that the connectivity between successive fibrils is anticipated to be through very small tie-molecules. On the other hand, the graft density of low-molecular weight P3HT crystallized on CNTs was low. Thus, the interconnectivity between successive fibrils is anticipated to involve large tie-molecules. The differences in connectivity between successive fibrils (besides the structural morphology), for low- and high-molecular weight P3HT, would at least, in part, impact the charge carrier mobility.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Recent developments on aqueous sodium-ion batteries", "Abstract": "For the extensive utilisation of renewable energy in future, we urgently require new generation of electric energy storage technologies that are low cost, environmentally friendly and sustainable in terms of the electrode and electrolyte materials.

The electroless deposition of iron particles onto the CF mat is reflected in a dramatically enhanced SE of ca. -54 dB (at 18 GHz) for an ultra-thin sheet of 0.6 mm as compared to the controlled sandwich structure (consisting of PVDF/CF) due to the presence of a conducting MWNT/PVDF film and magnetically active Fe@CF layer.

However, the conventional QSAR methods show difficulty in serving these purposes because a certain amount of molecular descriptors are difficult to be interpreted; however, they have low-cost and time-saving features. As such, mechanistically interpretable molecular descriptors were developed in this study in order to make the technique of the structure-activity relationship useful in the drug-action mechanism study. The structure-activity plots of the anthracycline anticancer activity (log GI(50)) against the mechanistically interpretable molecular descriptors: the polarizability (intercalation between the bases of DNA), the function in the dispersion interaction formula (passive diffusion through the lipid bilayers of cell membranes) and the energy change for the one-electron reduction (oxidative stress) were constructed. The descriptors were calculated by quantum chemical methods. The GI(50) values were obtained from the NCI-60 DTP human tumor cell line screen. This study shows that the intercalation strength and the passive diffusion rate dominantly contribute to cytotoxicity, but not the one-electron reduction according to the structure-activity plots. Therefore, the controversies of their contributions to cytotoxicity arising from the early experimental results are resolved. Moreover, the plots can describe how different chemical substituents affect anticancer activity. Also, the plots reveal that anthracyclines not only bearing morpholino and cyanomorpholino moieties and three-sugar-like units can behave with extraordinary anticancer activity, and the situations are more complicated than simply possessing them.

Experimental results show that the TAT peptide is not only capable of directly penetrating the biological membrane in a passive manner, but also forming physical, membrane-spanning pores that may facilitate transport. Experiments further show that anionic lipids accelerate peptide permeation within a range of mole percentage composition. In this work, we explored the structures and translocation thermodynamics of the cationic TAT peptide across a series of DPPC/DPPS model membranes with the presence of 0-30 mol% cholesterol. We computed the potentials of the mean force by using umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations coupled to the Martini coarse-grained force field. We systematically investigated the roles of cholesterol and anionic lipids (membrane surface charge) in TAT peptide translocation. In qualitative agreement with experimental findings, the barrier heights were significantly reduced in the presence of anionic lipids. A toroidal hydrophilic pore was strongly suggested by membrane structure analysis. Cholesterol stabilizes the liquid-ordered (Lo) phase of membranes and increases the elastic stiffness of bilayers. Consequently, it hinders transmembrane pore formation and thus modulates solute permeability, since the liquid-ordered phase suppresses reorientation of the lipid molecules on simulation time scales. Though cholesterol contributes marginally to the total free energy associated with peptide permeation, the coordination of cholesterol to the peptide weakens more favorable peptide-lipid interactions. The addition of the anionic lipid DPPS to the neutral DPPC bilayer leads to the emergence and further enhancement of an interfacially stable state of the peptide due to the favorable peptide-anionic lipid interactions. Translocation free energy barriers decrease in lockstep with increasing DPPS composition in the model bilayers simulated.

The cations swelled the bilayers in different amounts, in the order Fe2+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Zn2+. By decomposing the total bilayer electron density into different molecular groups, Zn2+ and Ca2+ were found to interact with the glycerol groups of the lipid molecules and cause minor swelling of the bilayers.

Hydrodynamic flow has been used to transport membrane species in supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) where the hydrophobic cores of the membrane species can be protected during processing. However, the forced convection mechanism of species embedded in lipid bilayers is still unclear. Developing a controlled SLB platform with a practical model to predict the membrane species mobility in the platform under in-lipid-membrane forced convection is imperative to ensure the practical applicability of SLBs in processing and managing membrane species with various geometrical properties. The mobility of membrane species is affected by the driving force from the aqueous environment in addition to the frictions from the lipid bilayer, in which both lipid leaflets may exhibit different speeds relative to that of the moving species. In this study, we developed a model, based on the applied driving force and the possible frictional resistances that the membrane species encounter, to predict how the mobility under in-lipid-membrane forced convection is influenced by the sizes of the species' hydrophilic portion in the aqueous environment and the hydrophobic portion embedded in the membrane. In addition, we used a microfluidic device for controlling the flow to arrange the lipid membrane and the tested membrane species in the desirable locations in order to obtain a SLB platform which can provide clear mobility responses of the species without disturbance from the species dispersion effect. The model predictions were consistent with the experimental observations, with the sliding friction coefficient between the upper leaflet and the hydrophilic portion of the species as the only regressed parameter. The result suggests that not only the lateral drag frictions from the lipid layers but also the sliding frictions between the species and the lipid layer planes could significantly influence the species mobility. The consistency between the experimental results and the model predictions suggests that our model based on lateral drag and sliding frictions between the species and the lipid leaflets can be used to describe the mobility of half-transmembrane species.

While it has recently been shown that such thread networks facilitate manipulation of fluid samples including mixing, flow splitting and the formation of concentration gradients, the passive capillary transport of fluid through the thread does not allow for precise control due to the random orientation of cellulose fibres that make up the thread, nor does it permit dynamic manipulation of the flow. Here, we demonstrate the use of high frequency sound waves driven from a chip-scale device that drives rapid, precise and uniform convective transport through the thread network. In particular, we show that it is not only possible to generate a stable and continuous concentration gradient in a serial dilution and recombination network, but also one that can be dynamically tuned, which cannot be achieved solely with passive capillary transport. Additionally, we show a proof-of-concept in which such spatiotemporal gradient generation can be achieved with the entire thread network embedded in a three-dimensional hydrogel construct to more closely mimic the in vivo tissue microenvironment in microfluidic chemotaxis studies and cell culture systems, which is then employed to demonstrate the effect of such gradients on the proliferation of cells within the hydrogel.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Catalytic oxidation of cellulose to formic acid in H5PV2Mo10O40 + H2SO4 aqueous solution with molecular oxygen", "Abstract": "The preparation of formic acid (FA) by catalytic oxidation of sustainable biomass is of significant conceptual and practical interest, because FA is an important chemical and is now produced from non-sustainable fossil fuel.

The influences of the pH on both the catalyst and the reaction pathway were discussed. By decreasing the pH, the oxidation potential and electron affinity were increased due to the formation of protonated H5PV2Mo10O40 and VO2+ species, favoring the reduction of the catalyst and oxidation of the substrate.

Analysis of the samples is conducted with GCxGC-TOFMS to achieve good resolution of the components within the complex mixture. The results reveal the dominant low molecular weight components and their concentrations as a function of pretreatment severity. Application of this method is also demonstrated in the context of lignin conversion technologies by applying it to track the microbial conversion of an APL substrate.

To find the suitable surfactant mixtures and levels of process variables (homogenization pressure and number of cycles-high pressure homogenization manufacturing method) that result in drug-loaded nanoemulsions with minimal droplet size and narrow size distribution, a combined mixture-process experimental design was employed. Based on optimization data, selected nanoemulsions were evaluated regarding morphology, surface charge, drug-excipient interactions, physical stability, and in vivo skin performances (skin penetration and irritation potential). The predicted physicochemical properties and storage stability were proved satisfying for ACF-loaded nanoemulsions containing 2% of SP in the blend with 0%-1% of SS and 1%-2% of egg lecithin (produced at 50 degrees C/20 cycles/800 bar). Additionally, the in vivo tape stripping demonstrated superior ACF skin absorption from these nanoemulsions, particularly from those containing 2% of SP, 0.5% of SS, and 1.5% of egg lecithin, when comparing with the sample costabilized by conventional surfactant-polysorbate 80.

Quantifying the effect of multiple coupled parameters in full-factorial fashion requires a prohibitively high number of experiments. We present a simple hydrogel-based platform for the rapid, full-factorial mapping of light and nutrient availability on the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae. We accomplish this without microfabrication using thin sheets of cell-laden hydrogels. By immobilizing the algae in a hydrogel matrix we are able to take full advantage of the continuous spatial chemical gradient produced by a diffusion-based gradient generator while eliminating the need for chambers. We map the effect of light intensities between 0 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 130 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (similar to 28 W m(-2)) coupled with ammonium concentrations between 0 mM and 7 mM on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our data set, verified with bulk experiments, clarifies the role of ammonium availability on the photosynthetic productivity Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, demonstrating the dependence of ammonium inhibition on light intensity. Specifically, a sharp optimal growth peak emerges at approximately 2 mM only for light intensities between 80 and 100 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) - suggesting that ammonium inhibition is insignificant at lower light intensities. We speculate that this phenomenon is due to the regulation of the high affinity ammonium transport system in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as well as free ammonia toxicity.

While all stabilizers inhibited aggregation of MWNTs, the stabilization effectiveness ranked as CMC > starch > LHA. In the presence of 0.06 wt% of CMC or 0.08 wt% of starch, 10 mg L-1 of MWNTs were fully stabilized (no gravity settling). At 10 mg L-1 of MWNTs, the addition of 5 mg L-1 as total organic carbon of CMC increased the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of MWNTs from similar to 25 to similar to 210 mM in NaCl solution and from similar to 0.9 to similar to 2.6 mM in CaCl2 solution. The three stabilizers showed very different effects on the electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of MWNTs: the coating of negatively charged CMC enhanced EPM from -3.24 x 10(-8) m(2) V-1 s(-1) for bare MWNTs to -5.22 x 10(-8) m(2) V-1 s(-1), while the coating of neutral starch slightly curbed EPM to -2.24 x 10(-8) m(2) V-1 s(-1), and LHA hardly affected EPM. Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory can interpret the stabilization mechanisms, which reveals that CMC stabilizes MWNTs through enhanced electrostatic repulsion, primary energy barrier and steric hindrance, whereas starch and LHA work primarily through steric hindrance. CMC and starch exert greater steric hindrance than LHA, partially due to the long chains of the polysaccharides and the associated steric hindrance.

The results showed that sulfhydryl groups gave the largest contribution, followed by lipids and amine groups, while the contribution of carboxyl groups could not be confirmed.

Based on the results, it was proposed that the TCS biosorption onto PDOS was determined by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding rather than electrostatic interaction. The TCS biosorption process depended much on initial pH and the optimum pH value was 4.0. Kinetic studies demonstrated that a pseudo-second-order model was more applicable for description of the biosorption of TCS onto PDOS; both intra-particle diffusion and boundary layer diffusion might affect the biosorption rate. The Dubinnin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm agreed well with the biosorption equilibrium data over the whole concentration range, and the maximum biosorption capacity was 124.55 mg g(-1), revealing that biosorption via PDOS could be used as an effective method for TCS removal from aqueous solution.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Gelatin-based dissolvable antibacterial films reinforced with metallic nanoparticles", "Abstract": "Six different types of metallic and bimetallic nanoparticles (Au, Ag, Cu, AuAg, AuCu, and AgCu) were prepared using an aqueous extract of Artemisia scoparia (AS) as reducing and stabilizing agents and gelatin/metallic nanoparticle composite films were prepared.

Two other cyanobacteria-laden sludge, aluminum chloride (AC) sludge and chitosan (CTS) sludge, were also studied to compare dewater performance with CTSAC sludge. Results showed that the dewatering process did not cause cell lysis and microcystins (MCs) release. The level of MCs and extracellular organic matter (EOM) in the filtrate were decreased by adsorption and sieving onto the cake layer formed on the membrane, but dewatering at high vacuum pressure reduced the rejection efficiency. The sludge from the coagulation process using the CTSAC composite displayed better sludge dewaterability and obtained a better quality of filtrate (fewer MCs and EOM) than those from AC and CTS coagulation processes independently. A three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence measurement indicated that protein-like substances in soluble extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) played a negative role on cyanobacteria-laden sludge dewatering. In addition, CTSAC sludge showed a more compact structure and larger floc sizes than AC sludge and CTS sludge for a strong improvement in the charge neutralization and bridge ability of AC by combining CTS in the composite coagulant. It was further observed that floc size played a more significant role on sludge dewaterability than the degree of compactness.

Measurement of the heat dissipation properties of different layers of super-aligned carbon nanotube (SACNT) films has been reported in this work. The equilibrium temperature of a hot copper plate could be reduced about 13.3% by the multilayer SACNT films. This feature indicates that multilayer SACNT films have very good heat dissipation properties, leading to the appearance of novel light-weight and high-performance heat dissipation materials.

It is found that in some systems the swelling of the bead (as a result of lowering the temperature) proceeds much more slowly than the preceding shrinking (as a result of the increase of temperature). Moreover, the initial volume of the bead is not restored, and a new stationary state of swelling is established. By means of optical dilatometry, it is found that in the systems in which the differences in the stationary states of swelling are found, the beads display plasto-elastic properties, whereas in the absence of such differences the beads show elastic properties. It is found that different stationary states of swelling are also established when the beads of copolymer of methacrylic acid cross-linked with divinylbenzene in Na+ form in the dry state and in the NaCl solution-swollen state are placed into a solution of a divalent cation salt. The difference in the stationary states of swelling reaches 12% in 4 N NiCl2 solution.

The synergy of these technologies with catalysis, their impact on the cellulose structure and reactivity are discussed. Particularly, we highlight that these non-thermal technologies not only induce a fast cleavage of the beta-1,4 glycosidic bond of cellulose but also promote random re-polymerization reactions yielding glucans with different types of glycosidic linkages (alpha/beta-1,4, -1,3, -1,6, -1,2) and degrees of polymerization. Remarkably, these technologies are capable of converting cellulose to soluble glucans at low temperature (<70 degrees C), a pivotal aspect with respect to sugar stability and purity. Furthermore, the absence of solvent (and catalyst in some cases) greatly facilitates the isolation of glucans. Thanks to the presence of different types of glycosidic linkages, these glucans are much more prone to functionalization or catalytic conversion than cellulose, thus paving the way for the production of macromolecules that have a great market potential. The electricity requirement is one of the main cost drivers for the implementation of these technologies.

The major challenge in a microalgae-based biorefinery is the efficient separation of microalgae from low-concentration culture broth. The post-harvesting cell-disruption step necessary to render microalgae suitable for lipid extraction, moreover, further raises energy consumption and cost. For the mitigation of biorefinery complexity and costs, we suggest herein a new scheme that integrates the critical downstream processes (harvesting and cell disruption) by means of cationic surfactant-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The cationic surfactants' quaternary ammonium heads play an important role in not only flocculating negatively charged microalgae but also weakening thick cell walls. In the present study, the harvesting efficiency and cell-damaging effects of three cationic surfactants - cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) - were evaluated.

This system takes advantage of the two ionization states of di-carboxylic acids to switch from a basic solution that pretreats biomass effectively to an acidic solution with conditions favorable for cellulases and back again for the next round of pretreatment.

For hydrophilic silica NP filled composites, an increase in the amount of bound carbonyl groups with increasing silica loading can be noted due to hydrogen bonding interactions with hydroxyls on the NP surfaces and carbonyl groups of PVAc. It is surprising that the apparent glass transition temperature (T-g) increases very slightly (similar to 1 K) compared to pure PVAc, but the glass transition process becomes much broader, indicating the existence of a slower relaxation mode. In addition to the bulklike alpha-relaxation assigned to polymer segments away from the NP surfaces, the nanocomposites also exhibit a slower interfacial alpha'-relaxation by 34 orders of magnitude compared to bulk polymers. However, in the case of hydrophobic (calcined) silica NP filled composites, T-g shifts to higher temperatures by 4-5 K even if there is the absence of strong polymer-NP interfacial interactions confirmed by the FTIR results. Consequently, the overall alpha-relaxation dynamics are suppressed in the presence of silica NPs, which is attributed to an increase of steric hindrance and decrease of free volume. More importantly, in the nanocomposites with high NP loadings, it is worth noting a weak physical adsorption interfacial layer for which the segmental mobility is on average slower by 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to that for bulk polymers. However, the dielectric strength and interfacial bound fraction is much smaller than that of hydrophilic silica NP filled composites, indicating the fact that physical adsorption is much weaker compared to hydrogen bonding", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Facile Synthesis of Molecularly Imprinted Graphene Quantum Dots for the Determination of Dopamine with Affinity-Adjustable", "Abstract": "A facilely prepared fluorescence sensor was developed for dopamine (DA) determination based on polyindole/graphene quantum dots molecularly imprinted polymers (PIn/GQDs@MIPs).

Arrays with as many as 225 emitters and with emitter density as large as 100 emitters cm(-2) were characterized using a solution of dissolved PEO in water and ethanol. Devices with emitter density as high as 25 emitters cm(-2) deposit uniform imprints comprising fibers with diameters on the order of a few hundred nanometers. Mass flux rates as high as 417 g hr(-1) m(-2) were measured, i.e., four times the reported production rate of the leading commercial free-surface electrospinning sources. Throughput increases with increasing array size at constant emitter density, suggesting the design can be scaled up with no loss of productivity. Devices with emitter density equal to 100 emitters cm(-2) fail to generate fibers but uniformly generate electrosprayed droplets. For the arrays tested, the largest measured mass flux resulted from arrays with larger emitter separation operating at larger bias voltages, indicating the strong influence of electrical field enhancement on the performance of the devices. Incorporation of a ground electrode surrounding the array tips helps equalize the emitter field enhancement across the array as well as control the spread of the imprints over larger distances.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "An Anisotropic Coarse-Grained Model Based on Gay-Berne and Electric Multipole Potentials and its Application to Simulate a DMPC Bilayer in an Implicit Solvent Model", "Abstract": "In this work, we aim at optimizing the performance of the anisotropic GBEMP model, which adopts a framework by combining a Gay-Berne (GB) anisotropic potential with an electric multipole (EMP) potential, in simulating a DMPC lipid bilayer in an implicit solvent model. First, the Gay-Berne parameters were initially obtained by fitting to atomistic profiles of van der Waals interactions between homodimers of molecular fragments while EMP parameters was directly derived from the expansion of point multipoles at predefined EMP sites. Second, the GB and EMP parameters for DMPC molecule were carefully optimized to be comparable to AMBER atomistic model in the calculations of the dipole moments of DMPC monomers adopting different conformations as well as the nonbonded interactions between two DMPC molecules adopting different conformations and separated at various distances. Finally, the GB parameters for DMPC were slightly adjusted in simulating a 72 DMPC bilayer system so that our GBEMP model would be able to reproduce a few important structural properties, namely, thickness (DHH), area per lipid ( AL) and volume per lipid ( VL). Meanwhile, the atomistic and experimental results for electron density profiles and order parameters were reproduced reasonably well by the GBEMP model, demonstrating the promising feature of GBEMP model in modeling lipid systems.

Benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene molecules were employed, and their Delta E-ST values were compared with those of their respective cofacial excimers. Our theoretical results demonstrate that, upon the formation of excimer, the Delta E-ST values decrease significantly. By carrying out an excitation energy decomposition, we found that Delta E-ST, albeit also modulated by the changes in orbital energy difference and Coulomb energy, is dominated by the difference in exchange energy between the singlet and triplet states, with the exchange energy decreasing as the intermolecular interactions become stronger. The natural transition orbital analysis suggests that the decrease in the exchange energy may be caused by the different nature of the hole and electron wave functions of the excimers (antibonding vs bonding), which gives rise to theft spatial separation. Furthermore, it was found that the geometry relaxation effects depend on the spin state, thus leading to a further reduction of Delta E-ST.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Photoalignment of an Azobenzene-Based Chromonic Liquid Crystal Dispersed in Triacetyl Cellulose: Single-Layer Alignment Films with an Exceptionally High Order Parameter", "Abstract": "Single-layer thin alignment films of dye molecules are of growing importance, particularly for state-of-the-art LCD technology.

Agarose gels, nitrocellulose membranes, and adsorptive microplates are often used as carriers to immobilize targets in the SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process, but the subsequent separation step is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, we used magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as carriers to immobilize the target, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which is convenient for fast magnetic separation. In this study, we first selected DNA aptamers against HBsAg by immobilizing HBsAg on the surface of carboxylated MNPs. The ssDNA library of each selection round was prepared by asymmetric PR amplification for the next selection round. To obtain aptamer sequences, the final selected products were purified by gel electrophoresis, then cloned, and sequenced.

One reason for this is that the transfer of the lab records into fabrication techniques which enable thermoelectric generator modules is very challenging. By closing the gap between record lab values and modules, broad industrial applications may become feasible. In this review, we compare three classes of materials, all designed for medium-high to high temperature applications in the field of waste heat recovery: skutterudites, half-Heusler compounds, and silicon-based materials. Common to all three classes of thermoelectric materials is that they are built from elements which are neither scarce (e.g. tellurium) nor toxic (e.g. lead) and therefore may be the foundation of a sustainable technology.

Here we report on a descriptive sensory analysis of wines made from grapes exposed to different vegetation sources of smoke to examine: (1) the effect vegetation source has on wine sensory attribute ratings and; (2) associations between volatile and glycoconjugated phenol composition and sensory attributes. Sensory attribute ratings were determined by a trained sensory panel and phenol concentrations determined by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Analysis of variance, principal component analysis and partial least squares regressions were used to evaluate the interrelationships between the phenol composition and sensory attributes. The results showed that vegetation source of smoke significantly affected sensory attribute intensity, especially the taste descriptors. Differences in aroma and taste from smoke exposure were not limited to an elevation in a range of detractive descriptors but also a masking of positive fruit descriptors. Sensory differences due to vegetation type were driven by phenol composition and concentration. In particular, the glycoconjugates of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin), 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethanone (acetovanillone), 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (syringaldehyde) and 1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanone (acetosyringone) concentrations were influential in separating the vegetation sources of smoke.

Dual-electrospinning is used to simultaneously electrospin PVAc and PCL, achieving an interwoven polymeric composite of otherwise immiscible polymers. The dual-electrospinning method facilitates precise control of the relative weight fractions of the components, and thus allows for tuning of the material properties. Upon thermal activation, damaged PVAc-PCL composites exhibited SH under a variety of testing conditions.

Besides, the properties of the preforms by the binder bonding are better than those by the oxidation bonding, which is mainly because the mixed neck-like-jointing and binder at high temperature provide effective bonding together.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "The Fabrication of Bio-ceramsite for the Removal of Heavy Metals and Its Toxicity to Bacteria", "Abstract": "Bio-ceramsite technology is one of the most effective technologies in the pretreatment of drinking water. In this work, bio-ceramsite was fabricated by Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) immobilization on the ceramsite. The findings of the current study suggest that the bio-ceramites showed biosorption abilities for Cd(II) and Pb(II) and the removal efficiency for Pb(II) is lower than Cd(II). The adsorption mechanism can be attributed to electrostatic attraction and covalent bond. The morphology of the cells changed after the adsorption of Cd(II) and Pb(II) due to the dissociation of the assembly of peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide. The fluorescence polarization has shown a significant decrease in membrane fluidity and an increase of permeability of cell membrane.

Here, we discuss how a mem-sensor can be fabricated using a single material with built-in sensing andmemory capabilities, based on ZnO microwires (MWs) embedded in a photocurable resin and processed from liquid by vertically aligning the MWs across the polymeric matrix using dielectrophoresis. This results in an ultraviolet (UV) photodetector, a device that is widely applied in fields such as telecommunication, health, and defense, and has so far implemented using bulk inorganic semiconductors. However, inorganic detectors suffer from very high production costs, brittleness, huge equipment requirements, and low responsivity.

Composites with aligned ZnO MWs produce giant photocurrentscompared to the same composites with randomly distributed MWs. In particular, we efficiently exploit a mem-response where the photocurrent carries memory of the last electronic state experienced by the device when under testing.

The selective composite formation (SCF) can also be found among the new technologies that were developed. This technology was first introduced in 2013, and because of its innovative character, there are still many challenges to be overcome. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to present a finite element method which allows to investigate the processing of the material during the selective formation of a composite material based on cellulose and acrylic. Design/methodology/approach - In the beginning, we introduced a brand new finite element method approach which is based on light transmittance network and photopolymerisation in transient state. This method is mainly characterised by internal light absorption, transversal reflectance, light transmittance coefficient and photopolymerisation kinetics. The authors defined experimentally the main model coefficients besides investigating the formation of composite material in six case studies. The main variables evaluated in those studies were the number of layers and the number of lines. By the end, the degree of polymer conversion and the preliminary evaluation of adherence between layers were identified in addition to the formation profile of composite material. Findings - The presented method evidence that the SCF resulted in a profile of polymerisation which is different from profiles found in vat polymerisation processes. It was shown that the light diffraction increases polymerisation area to outside of laser limits and reduces the penetration depth. It was also exposed that the selective formation of composite material on the top layer interferes with the polymerisation of previous layers and might increase the polymerised area in about 25 per cent per layer. By the end, adherence between layers was evidenced because of a high-pass filter that limited polymer conversion to over 60 per cent. In this case, the adherence between the top layers was provided by the interface between layers, while the deeper layers resulted in a solid formed by composite. Originality/value - This paper presents research results related to a very new AM technology and also proposes a new method to characterise this concept. Because of this new analytic approach, the process planning can be simulated and optimised, in addition to being a useful tool for other researches related to photocurable polymers and AM technologies.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Thiourea modified polyacrylnitrile fibers as efficient Pd(II) scavengers", "Abstract": "A series of thiourea modified fibers were prepared and characterized.

In this paper, SAp play a role as the shrinkage inhibiter to fabricate the SAp \"jammed\" polyimide gels. Herein, the \"jammed\" effect means that the polyimide backbones have been \"stretched up\" by the micron-scale SAp. Namely, the strong chains-packing effect, which is always taking placing during the gelation process and results in a high shrinkage of the polyimide backbones, has been effectively prevented by a simple physical mixture of SAp. This \"jammed\" effect greatly reduces the shrinkage as low as 7.5%. Meanwhile, SAp are treated as the pore formers to make a conversion to polyimide aerogel with ultra-low density of about 0.02 g cm (3). In addition, incorporation of SAp also dramatically enhances the hydrophobicity (water contact angle up to 152 circle). Overall, SAp \"jammed\" polyimide aerogels have low thermal conductivity (0.028-0.031 W m(-1) K-1), high mechanical strength, and high thermal stability.

Sodium alginate (SA) biopolymers and lanthanide ions (Nd3+, Gd3+, Ce3+ and Yb3+) were used as ideal building blocks and connection points, respectively. SA biopolymers and lanthanide ions rapidly self-assembled into an aligned hydrogel. The synthesized hydrogel was subsequently dried to form layered alginate-based papers.

SEM and HRTEM-EDS show that the magnetic graphene oxide nanoparticles were effectively dispersed on the cationic hydrogel matrix. The adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and effects of pH on AR88 uptake by MGO-CH were evaluated. The results show that MGO-CH achieves positive zeta potential values of 35.6-27.8 mV at pH 3.0-10.5, with a saturation magnetization of approximately 4.0 emu g(-1). The MGO-CH kinetics show a good fit with the pseudo-second order model. The maximum AR88 adsorption capacity of MGO-CH was 3476.7 mg g(-1) at an AR88 equilibrium concentration of 287.4 mg L-1 and pH = 7.0. Equilibrium adsorption data show that the Sips model is more suitable than the Langmuir and Freundlich models. MGO-CH exhibits an AR88 adsorption capacity of more than 1140.2 mg g(-1) in a strongly alkaline solution (pH > 10). The adsorption process is highly pH dependent, corresponding to electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and competitive adsorption interactions, and the optimal adsorption occurs at pH 3.0-5.8. The AR88 adsorption capacity of the regenerated MGO-CH approaches more than 95% of the fresh MGO-CH at a low initial concentration of 100 mg L-1 from the second to fifth recycles. As AR88 initial concentration increased up to 1500 mg L-1, the reusability of MGO-CH was decreased from the first to third cycle and was maintained stably afterwards. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that C-O and C=O functional groups contribute to AR88 adsorption. This finding was also confirmed by C 1s spectra from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The deconvolution of the N 1s spectra before and after AR88 adsorption indicates that the quaternary ammonium group of the cationic hydrogel contributes to AR88 removal.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Bio-based graphene/sodium alginate aerogels for strain sensors", "Abstract": "Highly flexible strain sensors based on graphene aerogels (GAs) have been widely researched.

The resulting aerogels exhibit outstanding durability (> 6000 loading-unloading cycles), excellent sensitivity to compression (gauge factor is 1.01) and bending (bending sensitivity is 0.172 rad(-1)).

Compared with normal responsive photonic crystals built by sensitive hydrogels, their intriguing properties, such as instant responsive behavior and more uniform diffractive color, are most attractive. The synthesis of magnetic nanocrystals for MRPCs requires a highly reliable and facile method to guarantee the monodispersibility and stability. Popularly used methods, especially those claimed as one-pot methods, were conducted in Teflon-lined autoclaves. However, several shortcomings, like expense of large scale equipment, safety issues with generating high pressures in reactions, and latent pollution issues of Teflon liners, have restricted the large scale application of autoclaves. Thus an alternative facile one-pot method for MRPCs has been developed in our work. It is simply conducted in glass containers with milder conditions such as ambient pressure, air atmosphere, and relatively low reaction temperature. Moreover, by fixing a relatively high stoichiometric ratio of alkali, the size of each unit can be readily controlled by the additional amount of water, as it is called the \"rich-alkali-poor-water\" (RAPW) method.

An urgent needs is being felt to develop a highly effective and extremely capable sorbent material for the removal of arsenic simultaneously in both species, i.e. As(III) and As(V) from the contaminated water. But in natural water As(III) is present in a non-ionic form which causes a great challenge to remove As(III) as compared to As(V) especially at a relatively low concentration. In this context the green chitosan thiomers with a high density of strong arsenic chelating (-SH) groups have been developed via thiourea reagent under conventional and microwave conditions and have been employed for the removal of As(III) and As(V). The sorption study supported almost identical sorption amounts of 17.0 and 17.6 mg g(-1) at 50 ppb for As(III) and As(V) via the thiomer, respectively. The synthesized chitosan thiomer even proved efficient in sorption of As(III) and As(V) at 10 ppb and purified water below the WHO prescribed detection limit. Moreover, the thiomer can be used for arsenic removal without any pH adjustment in the pH range of 6.0 to 9.0, which is in accordance with the pH of natural water. The As(III) and As(V) sorption mechanism on the surface of chitosan thiomer has also been confirmed by FTIR, Raman, XPS and cyclic voltammetry. Isotherm studies indicated that the Freundlich model is successful in describing the adsorption process to a better extent than the Langmuir model for the As(III) and As(V) adsorption on the chitosan thiomer. In the kinetic studies the pseudo second-order kinetic model supported the kinetic data best.

Cationic PhACs, for which the driving force for their adsorption results from electrostatic interaction via the exchange with the inorganic cations of the clay mineral, are almost completely removed for all studied experimental conditions where it appears that the S/L ratio plays a minor role and the only one limitation for their removal is the cation exchange capacity of the adsorbent. In contrast, anionic and neutral PhACs are adsorbed to the clay mineral surface (silanol groups on the sheet edges, inorganic cations.) through other interactional mechanisms involving ion-dipole, van der Waals interaction, leading to a competition of all organic molecules where their chemical nature (electric charge, hydrophobicity) may also play a role in their adsorption. While the adsorption of ketoprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and salicylic acid anionic PhACs slightly increases with the increase of the S/L ratio, the removal of the neutral and the other anionic PhACs (gemfibrozil and ibuprofen) seems to be independent of that ratio and is particularly enhanced.

Consequently, the film exhibits distinct reflective color, which can be easily tuned by adjusting the fabrication parameters. In this study, PG-MCC was demonstrated as a pH sensor by using a weak polyelectrolyte poly-(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP). The pH-induced swelling and deswelling of P2VP gel led to a substantial thickness change and hence a reflectance peak shift of PG-MCC. Highly reversible, linear, reliable and very fast responses to pH variations were exhibited.

FESEM images show that the spherical Pd nanoparticles (NPs) are homogeneously dispersed on the surface of CNFs and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements display a fcc structure of Pd. The surface area of the nanocomposite CNFs is greatly increased with the incorporation of the metal NPs up to 600 m(2) g(-1) and the presence of the metal promotes graphitization of the carbon.

Incorporating with a Pd/CNFs catalysed cathode, the Li-O-2 battery shows a very low voltage gap of 0.48 V vs. Li+/Li between the terminal discharge and charge voltages, as the recharge occurs at a potential underneath 4.0 V vs. Li+/Li for about 90 cycles at the curtailed capacity of 200 mA h g(-1).

The duration of the oxidative process severely affected the interlayer spacing in the resulting nanoplatelets and, consequently, they showed very different exfoliation behavior. Therefore, it was possible to obtain a variety of graphene-related products through their ultrasonication or thermal treatments such as exfoliation-reduction by flash-pyrolysis in air at temperatures between 400 and 1000 degrees C or standard activation with CO2 at 800 degrees C.

Despite the apparent homogeneity of the dispersions, their flow velocity profiles in cone-plate geometry, as measured by rheo-MRI velocimetry, differ strongly from those observed for typical thixotropic model systems: the viscosity across the gap is not uniform, despite a flat stress field across the gap.

In this work, we propose a novel way of estimating the dipolar repulsion using a passive method that involves the analysis of images of the monolayer with phase coexistence. This method is based on the comparison of the pair correlation function obtained from experiments with that obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of a model system.

Specifically, we focus on hydrophobic star-branched polyelectrolytes, composed of either strong or weak acidic monomers. While both collapse in a globule when uncharged, and expand to full stretching of arms at high ionization, they exhibit quite different intermediate scenarios. For the strong ones, we observe the formation of bundles of arms as the main structural motif, and for the weak ones the intramolecular micelle-like structure is found at the same overall charge of the macromolecule.

We focus on a transient instability that can be observed when the direction of applied flow is suddenly reversed, which induces compressive forces on the vesicle interface, and small-scale interface perturbations known as wrinkles develop. These wrinkles are driven by regions of negative elastic tension on the membrane. Using a stochastic immersed boundary method with a biophysically motivated choice of thermal fluctuations, we investigate the wrinkling dynamics numerically. Different from deterministic wrinkling dynamics, thermal fluctuations lead to symmetry-breaking wrinkling patterns by exciting higher order modes. This leads to more rapid and more realistic wrinkling dynamics. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data by Kantsler et al. [Kantsler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 99, 17802]. We compare the nonlinear simulation results with perturbation theory, modified to account for thermal fluctuations. The strength of the applied flow strongly influences the most unstable wavelength characterizing the wrinkles, and there are significant differences between the results from perturbation theory and the fully nonlinear simulations, which suggests that the perturbation theory misses important nonlinear interactions. Strikingly, we find that thermal fluctuations actually have the ability to attenuate variability of the characteristic wavelength of wrinkling by exciting a wider range of modes than the deterministic case, which makes the evolution less constrained and enables the most unstable wavelength to emerge more readily. We further find that thermal noise helps prevent the vesicle from rotating if it is misaligned with the direction of the applied extensional flow.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Solid state NMR studies of gels derived from low molecular mass gelators", "Abstract": "Since its invention more than six decades ago, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has evolved as an inevitable part of chemical as well as structural analysis of small molecules, polymers, biomaterials and hybrid materials. In the solution state, due to the increased viscosity of complex viscoelastic fluids such as gels, liquid crystals and other soft materials, the rate of molecular tumbling is reduced, which in turn affects the chemical shift anisotropy, dipolar and quadrupolar interactions. As a consequence the solution state NMR spectra show broad lines, and therefore, extracting detailed structural information is a challenging task. In this context, solid state (SS) NMR has the ability to distinguish between a minute amount of polymorphic forms, conformational changes, and the number of non-equivalent molecules in an asymmetric unit of a crystal lattice, and to provide both qualitative as well as quantitative analytical data with a short-range order. Therefore, SS NMR has continued to evolve as an indispensable tool for structural analysis and gave birth to a new field called NMR crystallography. Solid state cross polarization (CP) and high resolution (HR) magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy has been used to study weak interactions in polymer gels.

Our data disclose the mechanism for bulk CL in gluing SCs, steering their formation, and suggest how it may stabilize specific interfaces. We describe self-assembly molecular dynamics simulations of 9 cytochrome bc(1) (CIII) dimers and 27 cytochrome c oxidase (CIV) monomers from bovine heart mitochondria embedded in a CL-containing model lipid bilayer, aimed at mimicking the crowdedness and complexity of mitochondrial membranes. The simulations reveal a large diversity of interfaces, including those of existing experimental CIII/CIV SC models and an alternative interface with CIV rotated by 180 degrees. SC interfaces enclose 4 to 12 CLs, a similar to 10 fold enrichment from the bulk. Half of these CLs glue complexes together using CL binding sites at the surface of both complexes.

Amphiphilicity, a balance of cationic charge and hydrophobicity, in these polymers has been shown to be pivotal for their selective interactions with anionic lipid membranes of bacteria instead of zwitterionic mammalian (human erythrocyte) membranes. However, it is unclear if and to what extent hydrogen bonding in amphiphilic antibacterial polymers contributes to this membrane binding specificity. To address this, we employ isosteric substitution of ester with amide moieties that differ in their potency for hydrogen bonding in the side chains of N-alkyl maleimide based amphiphilic polymers. Our studies reveal that amide polymer (AC3P) is a potent antibacterial agent with high membrane-disrupting properties compared to its ester counterpart (EC3P). To understand these differences we performed bio-physical experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which showed strong interactions of AC3P including hydrogen bonding with lipid head groups of bacterial model lipid bilayers, that are absent in EC3P, make them selective for bacterial membranes. Mechanistic investigations of these polymers in bacteria revealed specific membrane disruptive activity leading to the delocalization of cell division related proteins.

Design/methodology/approach - Dispersions of silver particles (surface modified with oleic acid) in ethyl cellulose (EC) polymer solutions with and without thixotropic agent were prepared, and yield stress values were measured by setting shear stress to characterize the inter-particle interaction strength of pastes. Steady-state flow, three interval thixotropy shear test and oscillatory measurements were conducted to study the effect of EC polymer and thixotropic agent on viscosity, structure rebuilding and viscoelastic properties of electrode pastes. The effect of solvent was studied by investigating the steady viscosity of cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) polymer solutions and Ag dispersions. Findings - Weak flocculation network of silver particles was produced because of depletion flocculation. Besides the interaction between thixotropic agent micelles, EC polymer also has a significant interaction with thixotropic agent. Merely increasing EC polymer or thixotropic agent content is not the best way to prevent the layer printed from laying down. The effect of solvent on the viscosity of paste is mainly attributed to the difference of hydromechanics radius and configuration of CAB polymer in solvents. With the increase of organic medium content, the properties of electrode pastes were converted from rigidity to flexibility.

For example, the electrode polarization resistance is 0.25 Omega cm(2) under open circuit conditions while the current density is 1.1 A cm(-2) at 1.5 V for dry CO2 electrolysis at 800 degrees C. The performance is comparable with those reported for the Ni-YSZ fuel electrodes, where safe gas must be supplied. In addition, the performance is up to one order of magnitude better than those reported for other ceramic electrodes such as La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3-delta and La0.2Sr0.8TiO3+delta. Furthermore, the electrode exhibits good stability in the short-term test at 1.3 V for CO2-20 vol% H2O co-electrolysis, which produces a syngas with a H-2/CO ratio close to 2.

In the presence of TSCD, the reaction is slow as the complex appears to be more stable, leading to a preferentially oriented crystal growth. For instance, after mixing manganese acetate with TSCD, the formed Mn-citrate complex tends to release few Mn2+ ions steadily and slowly, which then react with the ligands at the initial stage of the reaction. Subsequently, the generated nuclei further grow from the interaction between the released Mn2+ and [Mn(CN)(6)](3-), [Co(CN)(6)](3-), or [Ru(CN)(6)](4-) anions to form several types of cyano-bridged coordination polymers (abbreviated as MnCNMn, MnCNCo, or MnCNRu, respectively). After thermal treatment in air, the as-prepared coordination polymers can be decomposed into their corresponding nanoporous Mn-based oxides. Surprisingly, the electrochemical analysis reveals that the Mn-Ru oxide prepared from MnCNRu is a promising catalyst for the production of H2O2 by selectively catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through an exact 2-electron pathway.

This enables the anticipated excellent rate and cycling stability because they can promote the reversible lithium ion intercalation and de-intercalation without huge volume change which consequently prevents the pulverization of active materials during repeated charge and discharge processes.

The structure, composition, and electrochemical properties are investigated in detail. The MoS2-C microspheres consist of few-layer MoS2 nanosheets bridged by carbon, which separates the exfoliated MoS2 layers and prevents their aggregation and restacking, thus leading to improved kinetic, enhanced conductivity and structural integrity. The novel architecture offers additional merits such as overall large size and high packing density, which promotes their practical applications.

X-ray crystal structure analysis shows that both cocrystals contain a folded molecular conformation of bicalutamide, similar to that seen in polymorph II of the pure drug. Calculations of intermolecular interaction energies using the PIXEL approach indicate closely comparable total lattice energies for [Bic + BZA] and [Bic + 2OHBZA]. The structures are dominated by dispersion interactions, with a significant contribution also from the coulombic interactions, particularly in [Bic + BZA]. The main difference between the two cocrystals is seen for the bicalutamide-cocrystal former interaction energy, which is calculated to be slightly more stabilizing in [Bic + BZA]. The melting temperatures of the cocrystals (132 degrees C for [Bic + BZA] and 157 degrees C for [Bic + 2OHBZA]) are significantly lower than that of the pure API (193 degrees C). In general, the melting temperatures of all known bicalutamide cocrystals are shown to increase with an increase of the total van der Waals volume (V-vdw) of the molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The thermodynamic functions of the cocrystal formation were estimated from the solubility of the cocrystals and the corresponding solubility of the pure compounds in chloroform at various temperatures. In both cases, the Gibbs energy of formation was found to be small: -3.4 kJ mol(-1) for [Bic + BZA] and -2.2 kJ mol(-1) for [Bic + 2OHBZA]. The most significant contribution to the Gibbs energy is provided by the exothermic enthalpy of formation. However, the cocrystal formation is accompanied by a considerable decrease of the system entropy, which diminishes the overall driving force of the process.

It is proposed that hydrophobic POPs could be captured in the hydrophobic bilayer of the synchronously formed cerasomes in aqueous environments with dieldrin as the model POP. The method was found to be highly efficient in the removal of trace level dieldrin in a range of 5 mg L-1 to 60 mg L-1.

This would lead to patient incompliances and discomfort. Therefore it is imperative to look for novel therapeutic systems with lesser side effects urgently to address the underlying causes of poor treatment outcomes associated with conventional therapy. Hence entrapping of cytarabine in a solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) based formulation could be a better alternative to sustain release and improve therapeutic activity by maintaining the plasma level. We chose tristearin as solid lipid and formulated it in nanoparticulate form by an ultrasonic emulsification method. SLN formulations were optimized and characterized for various physiochemical parameters like size (below 200 nm), charge, morphology and entrapment efficiency. An in vitro drug release study through a dialysis bag revealed a prolonged release of cytarabine.

Considering the relatively high cost and toxicity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) used in enzymatic composites, VGCF was investigated here, which has merits of low cost, less toxic characteristics and excellent electrical and mechanical properties. It was found that VGCF mixed very well with PANI and AuNPs could be attached onto VGCF. Both PANI/VGCF and AuNPs/VGCF showed good thermal stability, which were better than CNTs. The electron transfer rate constant (k(s)) of the AuNPs/VGCF/GOx bioanode was also measured, which was high (3.2 s(-1)) due to its good electrocatalytic activity. Investigation of their performance in GFCs showed that the maximum power density of a GFC using the PANI/VGCF/GOx bioanode was 22.26 mu W cm(-2), which was 1.7% higher than that of a GFC with PANI/CNT/GOx under the same experimental conditions. Moreover, the GFC with AuNPs/VGCF/GOx had a higher maximum power density (26.04 mu W cm(-2)) than that of a PANI/VGCF/GOx based GFC.

Recently, increasing attention has been given to low cost membrane materials such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers for water filtration. In this study, electrospun PAN nanofibrous membranes were functionalized with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and coated with a layer of electrospun chitosan (Cs), in order to improve the mechanical properties, and anti-bacterial and water filtration performance of the membranes. Morphological analysis revealed that the PAN/ZnO-Cs membranes featured a structural hierarchy comprising a layer of highly porous nanofibrous PAN membranes and a less fibrous and thinner layer of a Cs coating. Addition of the Cs layer increases the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the membranes. Results acquired from a water permeability test indicated that the bi-layer membranes possessed adequate transport properties for typical membrane applications. Furthermore, the additional Cs layer and ZnO nanoparticles significantly improved the heavy metal ion adsorption performance of the PAN membranes. Moreover, the efficiency of the PAN/ ZnO-Cs membrane for bacteria filtration has a log reduction value 2 orders of magnitude higher than PAN membranes, while the efficiency of these membranes for antibacterial action (i.e. in terms of log reduction value) is 6 orders of magnitude higher than PAN membranes.

The crystalline structure evolution of the BG component during the formation of the CNFs was characterized by XRD, SEM, and TEM observations in relation to silicon content. Then the apatite-forming ability of the hybridized CNF/BG in simulated body fluid was evaluated in relation to the crystalline structure of the BG component. Interactions between functional groups in PAN and BG sol-gel precursors were identified in the steps of electrospinning and heat treatment. As a result, the 45S-type BG containing less silicon formed alpha-CaSiO3, while the 68S-type BG containing more silicon transformed to beta-CaSiO3 in the final hybridized CNF/BG upon carbonization.

The TEM images showed the average diameter of PAN/TPU to be 107 nm with a core of 65 nm while TPU/PAN core-shell nanofibers have 156 nm average diameter with 82 nm core. FTIR data confirms the presence of TPU and PAN on core-shell electrospun micro/nano fibrous mats. The PAN/TPU core-shell electrospun mat exhibited better mechanical properties compared to TPU/PAN core-shell fibrous mats. Water contact angle results indicate that the shell polymer's hydroscopic (hydrophilic/hydrophobic) property influences the surface properties of electrospun mats. The water retention value tests were also performed for all electrospun fibers. The swelling thickness and porosity change in water were studied for pure TPU and PAN/TPU core-shell electrospun mats at two different temperatures (28 degrees C and 45 degrees C) for 20 min. The PAN/TPU core-shell mat showed an increase in swelled fiber diameter and a decrease in overall porosity with time which is more prominent at higher temperature (45 degrees C) due to the increase in vapor pressure from the hydrophilic core to its hydrophobic shell. The average porosity was found to be decreased from 62% to 48% at 45 degrees C while it was decreased from 61% to 52% at 28 degrees C, with immersion time of 20 min. Such an effect is not observed for pure TPU mat. Porosity increases at higher temperature as this elastomer shrinks.

The synthesized nGO exhibited self-assembly in solution. Furthermore, nGO strongly attached to the surface of starch granules by hydrogen bonding (nGO@ starch, 0.1 wt%) and allowed easy and highly efficient interfacial engineering in PLA/starch composites. After combining with polylactide (PLA), the composites could incorporate up to 30 wt% nGO@ starch, while retaining excellent properties. nGO was capable of facilitating PLA crystallization in the composites by providing a number of nucleation sites.

Yet to-date, block copolymer membranes have not been achieved using the droplet interface bilayer (DIB) method, which uniquely allows assembling single and multi-membrane networks between water droplets in oil. Herein, we investigate the formation of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(dimethyl siloxane)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer-stabilized interfaces (CSIs) between polymer-coated aqueous droplets in solutions comprising combinations of decane, hexadecane and AR20 silicone oil. We demonstrate that triblock-coated droplets do not spontaneously adhere in these oils because all are thermodynamically good solvents for the hydrophobic PDMS middle block. However, thinned planar membranes are reversibly formed at the interface between droplets upon the application of a sufficient transmembrane voltage, which removes excess solvent from between droplets through electrocompression. At applied voltages above the threshold required to initiate membrane thinning, electrowetting causes the area of the CSI between droplets to increase while thickness remains constant; the CSI electrowetting response is similar to that encountered with lipid-based DIBs. In combination, these results reveal that stable membranes can be assembled in a manner that is completely reversible when an external pressure is used to overcome a barrier to adhesion caused by solvent-chain interactions, and they demonstrate new capability for connecting and disconnecting aqueous droplets via polymer-stabilized membranes.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Crystallization behaviour of poly(ethylene oxide) under confinement in the electrospun nanofibers of polystyrene/poly(ethylene oxide) blends", "Abstract": "We have studied the confined crystallization behaviour of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) in the electrospun nanofibers of the phase-separated blends of polystyrene (PS) and PEO, where PS was present as the major component. The size and shape of PEO domains in the nanofibers were considerably different from those in the cast films, presumably because of the nano-dimensions of the nanofibers and the extensional forces experienced by the polymer solution during electrospinning. The phase-separated morphology in turn influenced the crystallization behaviour of PEO in the blend nanofibers. At a PEO weight fraction of >= 0.3, crystallization occurred through a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism similar to that in cast blend films. However, as the PEO weight fraction in the blend nanofibers was reduced from 0.3 to 0.2, an abrupt transformation of the nucleation mechanism from the heterogeneous to predominantly homogenous type was observed. The change in the nucleation mechanism implied a drastic reduction of the spatial continuity of PEO domains in the nanofibers, which was not encountered in the cast film. The melting temperature and crystallinity of the PEO crystallites developed in the nanofibers were also significantly lower than those in the corresponding cast films. The phenomena observed were reconciled by the morphological observation, which revealed that the phase separation under the radial constraint of the nanofibers led to the formation of small-sized fibrillar PEO domains with limited spatial connectivity. The thermal treatment of the PS/PEO blend nanofibers above the glass transition temperature of PS induced an even stronger confinement effect on PEO crystallization.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Wettability of PEDOT:PSS films", "Abstract": "Conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) are increasingly used to interface electronics with biology.

In contrast, the captive bubble technique on a fully wet film overcomes these limitations. Dynamic wettability measurements provide hysteresis values for this polymer and clarify the physical meaning of the static contact angles measured by sessile drop and captive bubble.

A simple method was developed to cast a hydrogel solution without external power sources using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold with micro-channels. This study employed \"the accumulation of vacuum pressure\" in a degassed lump of PDMS as a driving force for introducing agarose solution into the micro-channels. Sufficient vacuum pressure could be accumulated within 1 h in the PDMS elastomer that was acting as a vacuum tank, and 2 w/v% agarose solution could be aspirated into the micro-channels with widths from 100 to 2000 mm and a height of 19 mm, fully filling them. After the gelation and dehydration of agarose solution in the micro-channels, the patterns of agarose gel on the channels were successfully cast with a 90%-width accuracy.

One of the fundamental constraints in thermal radiation is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which limits the maximum power of far-field radiation to P-0 = sigma(TS)-S-4, where sigma is the Boltzmann constant, S and T are the area and the temperature of the emitter, respectively (Fig. 1a). In order to overcome this limit, it has been shown that near-field radiations could have an energy density that is orders of magnitude greater than the Stefan-Boltzmann law [2-7]. Unfortunately, such near-field radiation transfer is spatially confined and cannot carry radiative heat to the far field. Recently, a new concept of thermal extraction was proposed [8] to enhance far-field thermal emission, which, conceptually, operates on a principle similar to oil immersion lenses and light extraction in light-emitting diodes using solid immersion lens to increase light output [62]. Thermal extraction allows a black-body to radiate more energy to the far field than the apparent limit of the Stefan-Boltzmann law without breaking the second law of thermodynamics. Thermal extraction works by using a specially designed thermal extractor to convert and guide the near-field energy to the far field, as shown in Fig. 1b. The same blackbody as shown in Fig. 1a is placed closely below the thermal extractor with a spacing smaller than the thermal wavelength. The near-field coupling transfers radiative energy with a density greater than sigma T-4. The thermal extractor, made from transparent and high-index or structured materials, does not emit or absorb any radiation. It transforms the near-field energy and sends it toward the far field. As a result, the total amount of far-field radiative heat dissipated by the same blackbody is greatly enhanced above S sigma T-4, where S is the area of the emitter. This paper will review the progress in thermal extraction. It is organized as follows. In Section 1, we will discuss the theory of thermal extraction [8]. In Section 2, we review an experimental implementation based on natural materials as the thermal extractor [8]. Lastly, in Section 3, we review the experiment that uses structured metamaterials as thermal extractors to enhance optical density of states and far-field emission [9].", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Hierarchical porous nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide prepared by surface decoration-thermal treatment method as high-activity oxygen reduction reaction catalyst and high-performance supercapacitor electrodes", "Abstract": "Nitrogen doped (N-doped) porous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is successfully obtained by a two-step method, which includes a surface finishing of graphene oxide (GO) followed by thermal treatment.

While many of its properties are understood in a bulk solvent, its behavior in a small hydrophobic nanopore still raises fundamental questions. For instance, a wetting/dewetting transition in a hydrophobic solid-state or a polymer nanopore occurs stochastically and can only be prevented by external physical stimuli. Controlling these transitions would be a primary requirement to improve many applications. Some biological channels, such as gramicidin A (gA) proteins, show a high rate of water and ion diffusion in their central subnanochannel while their external surface is highly hydrophobic. The diameter of this channel is significantly smaller than the inner size of the lowest artificial nanopore in which water drying occurs (i.e. 1.4 nm). In this paper, we propose an innovative idea to generate nanopore wetting as a result of which the application of an external field is no longer required. In a nanopore, the drying or wetting of the inner walls occurs randomly (in experiments and in simulations). However, we have shown how the confinement of gA, in a dried hydrophobic nanopore, rapidly generates a stable wetting of the latter. We believe that this simple idea, based on biomimetism, could represent a real breakthrough that could help to improve and develop new nanoscale applications.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS: A REVIEW OF THE COOLING TECHNIQUES", "Abstract": "In this paper, current advances in cooling techniques and temperature control of photovoltaic (PV) panels in general, are analyzed and discussed.

The efficiency drops with the rise in temperature, with a magnitude of approximately 0.5 %/degrees C. Several cooling techniques have been tried, mostly based on active water and air cooling, as these are the simplest techniques. Other cooling techniques include conductive cooling, phase-change material cooling, etc. Increase in electrical efficiency depends on cooling techniques, type and size of the module, geographical position and the season of the year, and usually corresponds with a rise of 3-5 % in overall efficiency.

The demand for materials with a good ratio of high strength and light weight has arisen from new challenges inherent in changed working conditions and environments. In recent years, conventional steels have been successfully welded to high-strength steels (HSS). It is expected that demand for dissimilar welding of HSS will grow because of the characteristics of HSS and its diversity. The objectives of this study are to develop a framework for dissimilar high-strength metal welding compatibilities and to provide suitable welding procedure specifications necessary to achieve acceptable weld quality and flawless joints. In addition, the study takes into consideration the effect of high-strength steel manufacturing techniques on welding properties. The methods comprise an experimental review of scientific papers based on dissimilar metal welding experiments of high-strength steels and an analysis of the properties of different HSS grades, and the paper suggests different combinations of steels, electrode selection, welding processes and suitable heat treatments. The results show that dissimilar high-strength steels provide better mechanical joint properties with higher impact toughness resistance and better ductile-to-brittle transition. The corrosion resistance of the heat-affected zone and the weld depend on the alloy elements and the manufacturing of the base metal.

Cellular behavior, including attachment, proliferation, and differentiation, can be modulated by modifying nanofiber properties. Nanofibers that have been successfully used for the culture of including human pluripotent stem cells are classified as oligopeptide-immobilized nanofibers prepared from synthetic polymers, or natural polymers, and ECM-modified nanofibers. The combination of human ECM proteins or cell adhesion molecules and nanofibers with well-designed properties provides an alternative to traditional 2D media for the culture and maintenance of the pluripotency or the differentiation of hSCs.

However, in natural aquatic environments, especially marine environments, zinc electrodeposits suffer significantly from microbial induced corrosion and biofouling which lead to metal failure. To better confront the microbial induced problems, a biocide-zinc electrodeposit was synthesized based on chelating action. In this paper, nontoxic and biocidal natural polysaccharide, chitosan, was successfully incorporated into the zinc electrodeposit matrix, synthesizing a kind of chitosan-zinc composite electrodeposit. The addition of chitosan in the electrolyte influenced the surface morphology and crystalline structure of the resultant electrodeposits significantly, while a chitosan-zinc chelation complex was also found in the electrodeposits. A synthesis model was proposed in which a chitosan molecule could chelate zinc ions in the electrolyte by means of its N atoms in amino groups and O atoms in hydroxide radicals, which promoted the codeposition of zinc and chitosan during synthesis. Furthermore, remarkably enhanced broad-spectrum bactericidal properties of the chitosan-zinc electrodeposits were revealed through Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis exposure.

The electrospinning of CD/geraniol-IC-NFs with uniform and bead-free morphology was achieved without using a polymer matrix. Three types of CDs modified with hydroxypropyl and methyl groups (HP beta CD, M beta CD, and HP gamma CD) were used to obtain CD/geraniol-IC-NFs. The polymer-free CD/geraniol-IC-NFs allow us to attain much higher geraniol loading (similar to 11%, w/w) when compared to electrospun polymeric nanofibers containing CD/geraniol-IC (similar to 5%, w/w). Geraniol has a volatile nature, yet, a significant amount of geraniol (similar to 60-90%) was preserved in CD/geraniol-IC-NFs due to the complexation, whereas evaporation of geraniol was unavoidable for polymeric nanofibers incorporating geraniol without cyclodextrin. Short-term (3 h) temperature dependent release (37 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and 75 degrees C) and long-term open air (50 days, at RT) release tests revealed that M beta CD/geraniol-IC-NF released less geraniol compared to HP beta CD/geraniol-IC-NF and HP gamma CD/geraniol-IC-NF, indicating that much stronger inclusion complexation was formed between M beta CD and geraniol. The release of geraniol from CD/geraniol-IC-NFs prevented the colonization of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria to a great extent, as observed in the antibacterial activity results. It was observed that CD/geraniol-IC-NFs had higher antioxidant activity compared to pure geraniol due to the solubility increase.

It is possible to prepare heterogeneous analogues of the most commonly used homogeneous soluble catalysts by immobilizing them on various insoluble supports. The use of heterogeneous catalysts in chemical processes would simplify catalyst removal and minimize the amount of waste. Therefore, to maintain economic viability, a suitable heterogeneous system should not only minimize the production of waste, but should also exhibit activities and selectivities comparable or superior to the existing homogeneous route. Accordingly, catalysis by heteropoly (and related) compounds (HPCs) is a field of increasing importance, particularly concerning nanocatalysts. Furthermore, the heterogenization of bulk HPCs is an interesting area of research from an industrial point of view. As a rapidly growing and increasing field, HPC catalysis exhibits three main merits: (1) HPCs not only possess a strong acidic property, but also an oxidative property, which can support fast reversible multi-electron redox transformations under mild conditions. (2) HPCs exhibit fairly high thermal stability in supported or salt forms. (3) Their catalytic properties can be tuned in a wide range by changing their chemical compositions. A number of important heterogenization methods will be discussed in this review. These methods can be classified into two major categories: exchange of the HPC protons with cations (precipitation and hybridization) and immobilization of the HPCs on a suitable solid support (encapsulation, grafting, tethering and dispersion). Although these compounds have been known well for over a century, only in the last few years has scientific interest in these materials begun to increase dramatically.

To improve its efficiency, nisin was encapsulated in a poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-PGA) and chitosan nanoparticle system using self-assembly method. The effects of the nisin concentration and chitosan coating on the properties of the nanoparticles were investigated. The release behavior and transport mechanism of nisin from the nanoparticles were also examined under different conditions (temperature of 4 and 25 degrees C and pH of 3.0, 6.0 and 8.0 respectively). Results showed that the loading content (LC) and mean particle size of the nanoparticles were increased with the increasing of nisin concentration, but encapsulation efficiency (EE) was declined. The chitosan coating enhanced the stability of nanoparticle (higher zeta potential) and led to a higher EE and LC, and bigger mean particle size. FT-IR spectroscopy suggested that the formation of nisin/gamma-PGA/chitosan nanoparticle (N-P-C-NPs) was mainly attributed to the interactions among the function groups of chitosan, gamma-PGA and nisin by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The release of nisin from the nanoparticles exhibited a pH-dependent pattern, and the experimental data were fitted to a linear superimposition model which suggested that the release mechanism of nisin from the nanoparticles was an anomalous behavior. In addition, the in vitro antibacterial test showed that N-P-C-NPs was more efficient than nisin/gamma-PGA nanoparticle or nisin in inhibiting the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes, suggesting N-P-C-NPs could be developed as a promising novel food preservative.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Matrix-assisted diffusion-ordered spectroscopy", "Abstract": "Diffusion NMR is a potentially routine tool in the analysis of mixtures, from industrial and synthetic outputs to natural products.

However, the reinforcing effect of these nanoparticles is not as efficient for the elastic properties as expected from the classical models for polymer composites or fibrous materials. In this study, nanocomposite films made of TEMPO-oxidized NFCs and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were prepared by varying the NFC content over a wide range. The structural properties of these materials were characterized using AFM, TEM, SEM-FEG and XRD. These techniques showed that NFC nanocomposite films and nanopapers consisted of dense networks of tortuous NFCs with planar and random orientations. DMA experiments also revealed that the cohesive bonds between NFCs greatly contributed to the overall elastic response of these nanocomposites, even for low NFC contents. Based on these observations, we report an original multiscale network model that describes the elastic properties of NFC nanocomposites and nanopapers where the governing deformation mechanisms occurred at the numerous bonds between NFCs and in the NFC kinked regions, whereas the crystalline NFC regions were considered to be rigid bodies. This approach led to the formulation of an analytical expression for the stiffness tensors of NFC nanocomposites and nanopapers and revealed the effects of the network structure on their mechanical responses. The model predictions were satisfactory over the range of investigated NFC contents.

At the same time, the high sensitivity of the photo-orientation prevents the extension of this method to electro-optical elements such as LC displays and photonic devices. To stabilize LC alignment on dye films, several approaches have been developed which employ reactive mesogens (RMs) capable of photopolymerization. This article comprehensively describes the approach associated with the passivation of photoaligning films by thin layers of RMs. It is shown that continuous RM films with a thickness >= 5 nm provide highly uniform, thermally and photo-stable LC alignment. This approach also provides a VHR of more than 99%, RDC voltage less than 5 mV, and image sticking parameter about 1.002, which are the same as for rubbed polyimide films. Together with the low pre-tilt angle, high anchoring energy and ability of alignment patterning, this makes the proposed approach promising for application in a range of electro-optical devices, particularly those requiring active matrix driving and multi-domain alignment.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Detection of Salmonella bacteria in milk using gold- coated magnetic nanoparticle clusters and lateral flow filters", "Abstract": "A novel method was developed for the detection of Salmonella bacteria using gold-coated magnetic nanoparticle clusters (Au/MNCs) and lateral flow filters. Unlike a conventional lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) membrane, where antibodies are immobilized on test and control lines to observe a signal, the test line in the new method is formed simply by pressing a nitrocellulose membrane to decrease its thickness. Half-antibody fragment-functionalized Au/MNCs were used to capture Salmonella in milk and then dispersed in a small volume of buffer solution in which one end of the lateral flow filter was immersed. The free Au/MNCs rose to the pressed test line, while the Salmonella-Au/MNC complexes remained in the solution because they were too large to pass through the pores inside the lateral flow filter. The flow of free Au/MNCs was blocked at the test line because of the reduced pore size, and their accumulation caused the test line to darken. The color of the test line was inversely proportional to the Salmonella concentration, and the limit of detection for Salmonella in milk was determined to be 103 CFU mL(-1) after image processing. A control test using Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus revealed that the new lateral flow filtration method with Au/MNCs is highly selective for the detection of Salmonella.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Graphene quantum dots from fishbone carbon nanofibers", "Abstract": "Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQD) were obtained from fishbone carbon nanofibers (CNF) using a modified Hummers' method followed by ultrasound assisted exfoliation.

The suspension was subjected to further separation by degressive differential centrifugation obtaining fractions of different sizes and oxidation states. The resulting graphene oxide-based products consisted of a mixture of expanded CNF, few-layer graphene oxide sheets and GOQD, the latter accounting for a yield of 42 wt% with respect to the initial CNF weight. The photoluminescence properties were dependent on the size and the oxidation state of each fractionated graphene oxide-based suspension. GOQD showed an excitation-dependent photoluminescent emission with a maximum at 578 nm (yellow) for an excitation of 455 nm. After hydrothermal reduction, reduced GOQD (rGOQD) exhibited bright violet photoluminescence at 448 nm for 330 nm of excitation due to the removal of hydroxyl and epoxide groups from basal planes of the graphene network.

The grafted material was used as a catalyst for the oxidation of ethylbenzene with molecular oxygen. Common spectroscopic techniques, in particular X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were used to characterize the grafted material. We found that the coordination of chitosan to manganese porphyrin changed the electron cloud densities of the manganese ion in the catalytic center. This promoted cleavage of the Mn-Cl bond in the Mn TCPP/pd-CTS, it tripled the catalytic activity of manganese tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin and the catalytic efficiency of the metalloporphyrin.

The technique was based on catanionic assemblies of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium dodecyl sulphate surfactants as a new green extraction solvent for use in a dispersive microextraction method coupled with electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. This technique benefits from the safe and green properties of the supramolecular aggregates rather than the hazardous and volatile organic solvents commonly used in liquid-liquid microextraction methods. The main component of the dispersive solvent is water and a direct interaction between the extraction solvent and the analyte is possible. The separation behaviour of the sodium dodecyl sulphate/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide solvent phase and various parameters influencing the extraction efficiency of lead (e.g. pH, salt concentration, centrifugation time, amount of ligand and extraction solvent) were investigated and optimized.

Various CNF-NGO (CNG) and TCNF-NGO (TCNG) composite films prepared with 0.5-3 wt% of NGO were analysed structurally by FTIR and XRD spectroscopy, and evaluated optically by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis using SEM showed good dispersibility of the NGO sheets in the randomly-distributed CNF, and the dense and parallel-oriented TCNF cellulose nanofibrils. Such a synergistic effect of both components contributed to ultra-strong and ultra-stiff composite films with good mechanical and thermal stability, although they were more brittle with a smoother surface and lower transmittance for the TCNF based films, due to the stronger physico-chemical interactions with NGO. The dielectric performance was verified with a higher (3 wt%) NGO loading capacity, which resulted in a dielectric constant of similar to 46 vs. similar to 52, and conductivity of similar to 2.07 x 10(-4) S m(-1) vs. 3.46 x 10(-4) S m(-1) for CNG vs. TCNG films, respectively, at a frequency of 1 MHz, showing greater enhancement than other reported studies.

The chemical structure and composition characterizations of the cotton fabric were carried out using corresponding characterization techniques, which indicated that, in the process of in situ polymerization, the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose, to a certain extent, could also be involved in the reaction and confirmed that the hydrophobicity of treated cotton (with a maximal contact angle of approximately 124 degrees) was a result of the synergetic effect of low surface energy of PFOS and the coexistence of micro/nano structures on the cotton surface. The results of cyclic voltammetry, fiber resistance testing, and thermal analyses proved that the electro-optical properties and thermal stability of cotton fabric were drastically enhanced by PFOS-doped PANI. Utilizing the doping/dedoping process of PANI, the wettability of treated cotton underwent a reversible change from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Color tests and zeta potential measurements served as auxiliary evidence to explain the mechanism of the wettability switch of the functionalized cotton.

Results showed that DGP and CSAD exhibit competitive adsorption behaviour at the water-gas interface and that this competitive behaviour can be intensified by NaCl. EPR revealed that the cholesterol groups of CSAD participate in the formation of micellar structures. The steric effect of the cholesterol groups reduces the microviscosity of the micellar structure, but high-concentration NaCl can weaken the polarity and increase the microviscosity of the formed micellar structure. In addition, at a high DGP concentration, high-concentration NaCl can facilitate DGP precipitation; this condition causes abnormal phenomena of surface tension, fluorescence spectroscopy, and EPR. For the emulsion system, analysis of particle size and rheology indicated that DGP and CSAD form a network structure between oil and water interfaces through interaction and thus enhance the non-Newtonian fluid properties of the emulsion. Owing to the competitive adsorption between CSAD and DGP at the oil-water interface, DGP gradually replaces CSAD with the increase in DGP concentration.

We therefore present the strategic design of functionality in cost-effective, affordable artificial materials starting from a spectrum of simple synthetic options to end up with carbon- and nitrogen-based porous frameworks. Following the synthetic strategies, we demonstrate how the electronic structure of polymeric frameworks can be tuned and how this can modify property profiles in a very unexpected fashion. Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs), for instance, showed both enormously high energy and high power density in lithium and sodium battery systems. Other C,N-based organic frameworks, such as triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride, are suggested to show promising band gaps for many (photo)electrochemical reactions. Nitrogen-rich carbonaceous frameworks, which are developed from C,N-based organic framework strategies, are highlighted in order to address their promising electrocatalytic properties, such as in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). With careful design, those materials can be multifunctional catalysts, such as a bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst. Although the majority of new C,N-based materials are still not competitive with the best (usually nonsustainable candidates) for each application, the framework/N approach as such is still in its infancy and has already moved organic materials to regions where otherwise only traditional noble metals or special inorganic semiconductors are found.

In order to integrate all of the above versatile subjects from synthesis to applications on C,N-based organic frameworks, we begin the discussion with synthetic concepts and strategies for these frameworks to distinguish these systems from typical covalent organic frameworks based on boron oxide rings. Next we focus on the semiconducting properties of C,N-based organic frameworks in order to show a continuous transition between CTFs and other systems, such as graphitic carbon nitrides. At the end, applications of these materials are shown by highlighting their properties in electrochemical energy storage and photo- and electro catalysis.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Tubular Unimolecular Transmembrane Channels: Construction Strategy and Transport Activities", "Abstract": "Lipid bilayer membranes separate living cells from their environment. Membrane proteins are responsible for the processing of ion and molecular inputs and exports, sensing stimuli and signals across the bilayers, which may operate in a channel or carrier mechanism. Inspired by these wide-ranging functions of membrane proteins, chemists have made great efforts in constructing synthetic mimics in order to understand the transport mechanisms, create materials for separation, and develop therapeutic agents. Since the report of an alkylated cydodextrin for transporting Cu2+ and Co2+ by Tabushi and co-workers in 1982, chemists have constructed a variety of artificial transmembrane channels by making use of either the multimolecular self-assembly or unimolecular strategy. In the context of the design of unimolecular channels, important advances have been made, including, among others, the tethering of natural gramicidin A or alamethicin and the modification of various macrocydes such as crown ethers, cydodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils. Many of these unimolecular channels exhibit high transport ability for metal ions, particularly K+ and Na+ Concerning the development of artificial channels based on macrocyclic frameworks, one straightforward and efficient approach is to introduce discrete chains to reinforce their capability to insert into bilayers. Currently, this approach has found the widest applications in the systems of crown ethers and calixarenes. We envisioned that for macrocyde-based unimolecular channels, control of the arrangement of the appended chains in the upward and/or downward direction would favor the insertion of the molecular systems into bilayers, while the introduction of additional interactions among the chains would further stabilize a tubular conformation. Both factors should be helpful for the formation of new efficient channels. In this Account, we discuss our efforts in designing new unimolecular artificial channels from tubular pillar[n]arenes by extending their lengths with various ester, hydrazide, and short peptide chains. We have utilized well-defined pillar[S]arene and pillar[6]arene as rigid frameworks that allow the appended chains to afford extended tubular structures. We demonstrate that the hydrazide and peptide chains form intramolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O=C hydrogen bonds that enhance the tubular conformation of the whole molecule. The new pillar[n]arene derivatives have been successfully applied as unimolecular channels for the selective transport of protons, water, and amino acids and the voltage-gated transport of K+. We also show that aromatic hydrazide helices and macrocydes appended with peptide chains are able to mediate the selective transport of NH4+.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Self-Assembled Three-Dimensional Graphene Macrostructures: Synthesis and Applications in Supercapacitors", "Abstract": "Graphene and its derivatives are versatile building blocks for bottom-up assembly of advanced functional materials. In particular, with exceptionally large specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and superior chemical/electrochemical stability, graphene represents the ideal material for various electrochemical energy storage devices including supercapacitors. However, due to the strong pi-pi interaction between graphene sheets, the graphene flakes tend to restack to form graphite-like powders when they are processed into practical electrode materials, which can greatly reduce the specific surface area and lead to inefficient utilization of the graphene layers for electrochemical energy storage. The self-assembly of two-dimensional graphene sheets into three-dimensional (3D) framework structures can largely retain the unique properties of individual graphene sheets and has recently garnered intense interest for fundamental investigations and potential applications in diverse technologies. In this Account, we review the recent advances in preparing 3D graphene macrostructures and exploring them as a unique platform for supercapacitor applications. We first describe the synthetic strategies, in which reduction of a graphene oxide dispersion above a certain critical concentration can induce the reduced graphene oxide sheets to cross-link with each other via partial pi-pi stacking interactions to form a 3D interconnected porous macrostructure. Multiple reduction strategies, including hydrothermal/solvothermal reduction, chemical reduction, and electrochemical reduction, have been developed for the preparation of 3D graphene macrostructures. The versatile synthetic strategies allow for easy incorporation of heteroatoms, carbon nanomaterials, functional polymers, and inorganic nanostructures into the macrostructures to yield diverse composites with tailored structures and properties. We then summarize the applications of the 3D graphene macrostructures for high-performance supercapacitors. With a unique framework structure in which the graphene sheets are interlocked in 3D space to prevent their restacking, the graphene macrostructures feature very high specific surface areas, rapid electron and ion transport, and superior mechanical strength. They can thus be directly used as supercapacitor electrodes with excellent specific capacitances, rate capabilities, and cycling stabilities. We finally discuss the current challenges and future opportunities in this research field. By regarding the graphene as both a single-atom-thick carbon sheet and a conjugated macromolecule, our work opens a new avenue to bottom-up self-assembly of graphene macromolecule sheets into functional 3D graphene macrostructures with remarkable electrochemical performances.

Using apoptosis as an example, we illustrate that the combination of enzymatic transformation and self-assembly, in fact, is an inherent feature of apoptosis. After the introduction of EISA of small molecules in the context of supramolecular hydrogelation, we describe several key studies to underscore the promises of EISA for developing cancer therapy.

In this paper, a nonlinear, transient finite element formulation is presented for initial boundary value problems associated with swelling and deformation of hydrogels, based on a nonlinear continuum theory that is consistent with classical theory of linear poroelasticity. A mixed finite element method is implemented with implicit time integration. The incompressible or nearly incompressible behavior at the initial stage imposes a constraint to the finite element discretization in order to satisfy the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition for stability of the mixed method, similar to linear poroelasticity as well as incompressible elasticity and Stokes flow; failure to choose an appropriate discretization would result in locking and numerical oscillations in transient analysis. To demonstrate the numerical method, two problems of practical interests are considered: constrained swelling and flat-punch indentation of hydrogel layers. Constrained swelling may lead to instantaneous surface instability for a soft hydrogel in a good solvent, which can be regulated by assuming a stiff surface layer. Indentation relaxation of hydrogels is simulated beyond the linear regime under plane strain conditions, in comparison with two elastic limits for the instantaneous and equilibrium states. The effects of Poisson's ratio and loading rate are discussed. It is concluded that the present finite element method is robust and can be extended to study other transient phenomena in hydrogels.

Impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge tests show that the compositions are insensitive to accidental ignition and are safe to handle.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Preparation of the Monolith of Hierarchical Macro-/Mesoporous Calcium Silicate Ultrathin Nanosheets with Low Thermal Conductivity by Means of Ambient-Pressure Drying", "Abstract": "Calcium silicate monolith was prepared by the hydrothermal reaction of a slurry of SiO2, calcium hydroxide, and surfactant (OP-10) obtained by high-energy ball milling, followed by drying at ambient pressure. By using this strategy, the shrinkage due to the collapse of pores during the drying of porous materials, which is a commonly observed phenomena, was successfully avoided. It has a unique microstructure of hierarchical macro-/mesoporous ultrathin calcium silicate nanosheets with a layered gyrolite crystalline structure. Very interestingly, the calcium silicate nanosheets can be peeled off to give a single-layer nanosheet (1.23nm) of gyrolite by ultrasonication. The monolith has a low apparent density (0.073gcm(-3)) and low thermal conductivity (0.0399WK(-1)m(-1)). The reasons behind why the formation of the unique hierarchical macro-/mesoporous ultrathin nanosheets avoids shrinkage during the hydrothermal reaction and drying, and considerably decreases the thermal conductivity, is discussed.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Self-replication of DNA rings", "Abstract": "Biology provides numerous examples of self-replicating machines, but artificially engineering such complex systems remains a formidable challenge. In particular, although simple artificial self-replicating systems including wooden blocks(1,2), magnetic systems(3,4), modular robots(5,6) and synthetic molecular systems(7-9) have been devised, such kinematic self-replicators(10) are rare compared with examples of theoretical cellular selfreplication(11-18). One of the principal reasons for this is the amount of complexity that arises when you try to incorporate self-replication into a physical medium(19). In this regard, DNA is a prime candidate material for constructing self-replicating systems due to its ability to self-assemble through molecular recognition(20). Here, we show that DNA T-motifs, which self-assemble into ring structures(21,22), can be designed to self-replicate through toehold-mediated strand displacement reactions(23,24). The inherent design of these rings allows the population dynamics of the systems to be controlled. We also analyse the replication scheme within a universal framework of self-replication(25) and derive a quantitative metric of the self-replicability of the rings.", "Label": "Material Science"}, {"Title": "Stereoretentive Palladium-Catalyzed Arylation, Alkenylation, and Alkynylation of 1-Thiosugars and Thiols Using Aminobiphenyl Palladacycle Precatalyst at Room Temperature", "Abstract": "A general and efficient protocol for the palladium-catalyzed functionalization of mono- and polyglycosyl thiols by using the palladacycle precatalyst G3-XantPhos was developed. The CS bond-forming reaction was achieved rapidly at room temperature with various functionalized (hetero)aryl-, alkenyl-, and alkynyl halides. The functional group tolerance on the electrophilic partner is typically high and anomer selectivities of thioglycosides are high in all cases studied. New sulfur nucleophiles such as thiophenols, alkythiols, and thioaminoacids (cysteine) were also successfully coupled to lead to the most general and practical method yet reported for the functionalization of thiols.", "Label": "Chemistry"}, {"Title": "Geographical and Geological Origin of Natural Graphite Heavily Influence the Electrical and Electrochemical Properties of Chemically Modified Graphenes", "Abstract": "Natural graphite is an important precursor for the production of chemically modified graphenes in bulk quantities for electrochemical applications. These natural graphites have varying fundamental properties due to the different geological processes and environments at their points of origin, which are expected to affect their chemical reactivity and hence the properties of the derived graphene materials. Four different natural graphites with known geographical and geological origins were exposed to a modified Hummers oxidation method and the resulting graphite oxides were studied. The graphite oxides were shown to have different extents of oxidation and types of oxygen groups, which directly influenced their electrochemical properties. These differences were propagated further in the subsequent chemical reduction of the graphite oxides, and the reduced graphene oxides exhibited significantly different reduction efficiencies and electrical conductivities. These findings show that the choice of natural graphite of known origin is important to synthesize chemically modified graphenes with a desired set of properties.", "Label": "Chemistry"}]
